# Sentiment Analysis of Elden Ring Steam Reviews

This project analyzes Elden Ring reviews from Steam using VADER and a BERT-based sentiment analysis model (nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment). The dataset consists of user reviews, which were preprocessed and analyzed to determine sentiment polarity. VADER classifies reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, while the BERT model predicts sentiment on a 1 to 5-star scale, later grouped into three categories. The results are visualized using Matplotlib, comparing the sentiment distributions from both models.
