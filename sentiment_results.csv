1,134238208,"I write this review as I have 100% completed Elden Ring. And yet, despite this, I still find new things every time I play the game.

Elden Ring is an experience to say the least, and I won't be dramatic and say it is life changing but it feels like this is THE video game to play if you're ever going to play a game. It's immersive and full of story, every little thing is made with such refined detail that you can easily miss the little things. Everything feels so interconnected and it is so easy to get lost and find yourself on an adventure.
It's been a long time since I've felt like a game really wanted me to just... go explore and have fun with the world. It feels punishing but no punishment in this game goes unrewarded.

Here's my breakdown of the game, I'll try not to spoil but I'll post spoiler warnings just in case.

*Story*:

As any Fromsoft game is, the world is vague and extremely open ended. Which can be a huge mess if done wrong but this is done entirely right. Story is not handed to you on a silver platter, however if you do wish to go find it through character storylines, you're given plenty of exposition and development. Characters are made to make you care about them or hate them. A lot.
Where Elden Ring shines is the characters that they weave into the story and how important bosses feel to kill due to story context. The context you are given bit by bit really sell your journey.

*The Endings*:

(I have not done Golden Mask or Dungeater's ending as they do not really interest me too much. Do note there are spoilers up ahead so skip this section if you don't want that)

-Ranni's Ending was actually one of the most satisfying endings to a Souls game I've seen in a long time. She was a compelling character and her roster of companions feel fun and diverse in their own ways. They take you on this meaningful journey with twists and questionable moral choices. And to wrap it all up nicely after taking you underground to Nokron, Fromsoft has you revisiting areas previously to ground you in Ranni's backstory via Liurnia.
I 100% recommend getting this ending and I'll be posting a guide soon!

-Frenzy Flame Ending was... something? It wasn't exactly remarkable but I did really enjoy the voice acting! I can't say the way to get it was entertaining though, go through some sewers, comet azur Mohg, and take 5 minutes to jump on some graves and now you have an ending only 15% of people this game have. It didn't feel satisfying but it was visually neat and the eyes look really radical.

-Elden Lord. Nuff said, you become elden lord. A decent neutral ending!

-Fia's. This one was actually really mysterious and fun. Full of deceit and conflict. You don't get an achievement with this alas but it's worth doing. Fun bosses, neat story, Fia being based.


*Gameplay*

It takes some getting used to. I grew up on the souls games and I am used to fast paced movements. But I really had to be patient with this one! Lots of delay which forces you to pay attention to the details of certain bosses. Also adding jumping in with some of the mechanics was really neat! Albeit a bit annoying from time to time (Cough, Godfrey, Cough).

The dungeons and caves are plenty of fun and remind me of old legend of zelda mechanics. The bosses are fun and engaging, always on your toes. Although Rennala was a slight bore phase 1.
You can take your time or zoom through the Main Story. Going back to back in the story takes around 2-4 hours. But there's so much to do in the game that it might take you 100+ hours to even complete it.

15,134232196,"Honestly fun, challenging boss fights. Keeps the mechanics of previous titles, and makes it more friendly for new players as they can just explore and come back later. 

A vast arsenal, and chances are you can use the weapon you want to use because for most non unique weapons you can add weapon arts to them. These weapon arts increase damage/ let you choose what they scale with, and add a new ability onto them.

Plenty of spells, and most of them all generally have their uses, some for insane cheese (Dragon rot breath, Comet Azur). The most frustrating thing about them, is that enemies input read to dodge your shots, so delaying and or just trying to get a quick hit will normally be futile. The counter to the enemy dodge, is to just do it again. For some reason they decided that the ai should only be able to dodge a certain amount of times.

And leading on from my last point: Bows, I am doing a bow only build, it is painful to just have the game decide half of your shots aren't going to hit, and if you try to attack while a boss is channeling something, generally the bow will lock you out of dodging away. Unless you are using a composite bow/ a quick bow that has a dodge attack you will be hit if your not a mile away from the boss. Using a small bow to relieve these issues kind of suck, as they are only really useful for applying status effects and not damage. Though it is understandable that bows should be weaker, but when you compare them to mage/faith counter parts it feels rough.

Biggest downside to me of this game is [strike] it's not darksouls 4. [/strike] is that the open world kind of makes the game less linear, which is what appealed to me in ds3.

Elden Ring is the best game I have ever played. Simple as that.

20,134230930,"This game is definitely a worthwhile playthrough for anyone who may take the slightest interest in this genre. Though, I must say this game's end game does not have the most polish when compared to the beginning of the game. Bosses are overly punishing and overly active. The philosophy of bosses seems to have been very muddied. Bosses with large health pulls will have attacks capable of nearly one-shotting any build that does not dump vigor. Most early-game bosses are challenging, but well made enough to be beaten at any point in the game depending on skill level. The later bosses are very different on the other hand. The over-aggressive nature of bosses and their habit to end combos just to immediately begin a new one before you can properly achieve a hit is an incredibly frustrating one. Leaving you to always be overly cautious in order to even get an attack in. Forcing the players to constantly be on the defensive and break the flow of combat creates a less interesting environment and gameplay loop. It seems like the developers decided to focus on making the bosses more ""challenging"" rather than fun. Bosses being challenging is a perfectly fine mechanic and is fundamental to the franchise, but Elden Ring seems to tip the scales, several times, into the frustrating territory. Having to wait an entire Youtube Ad's length of time for a proper opening in a boss only to do minimal damage is just not a fun way to play the game. Spending several minutes whittling a massive health bar, only to be instantly killed by singular mistake is not a fun way to play a game. Bosses with small health pools that are incredibly punishing are completely fine and enjoyable challenges. Bosses with massive health pools that spend most of their time whittling you down for your mistakes over time are also completely fine and enjoyable. It's when the two are mixed, is when you create an overall frustrating experience. Do not get me wrong. I love this game and enjoyed the many hours I put into it, but the game's late game bosses make it a difficult choice to want to replay it. 7/10 game trapped in a 10/10 frame.

73,134219464,"""I offer you an accord."" 

Elden Ring is truly FromSoftware at its peak, while I love the Dark Souls games, I think Elden Ring's world and lore are by far my favorite. The characters all feel like they are moving towards their own goals, and you are just a pawn for most of them. By the end of the game you could accept your fate or align your goals among one of these many characters, or flip everything on its head for yourself. I think the endings for the game are very interesting, and investigating to learn the lore of the game for myself was very fun for me! The design of characters and bosses in this game is also very interesting, as some have strange connections to the lore that lead you to learning more as you examine and play. Some just make for good mysteries too, leading you to craft your own theories about things. While I hope we get more explanations for things in future DLC's I'm also fine with things remaining mysterious, as it allows everyone to keep their own theories about the game. Gameplay feels a lot smoother than the clunkiness of the other Souls games I've played too. As a heavy greatsword builder I've also never been happier with how easy it is to achieve the build you're going for. 
The soundtrack is also killer, as most souls games are when it comes to their tracks. Wandering the world had to be my favorite part of the game, whereas in other Souls game, trekking along can feel like a drag.

85,134217284,"Should you play Elden Ring?

FromSoft and the Soulslike genre certainly have a strong, dedicated following, but maybe that's not you. Perhaps you've never played this kind of game before and you aren't sure if you can trust they hype. I humbly offer my perspective, as someone who entered the world of Elden Ring (hereafter referred to as the Lands Between) with absolutely no experience with other FromSoft games or the brutally unforgiving genre from which it arose.

I finally took the leap and bought Elden Ring because I love exploring open worlds. Linear gameplay can be great, but there is something especially appealing to me about a huge world that I can wander through freely, especially those with a sword-and-sorcery aesthetic. From RuneScape and Guild Wars to the Elder Scrolls and The Witcher, just give me a sword, a bow, some spells, and a world to get lost in.

Here was a new world to explore in the Lands Between, and please believe me when I say I was not disappointed. The Lands Between are at times beautiful, terrifying, breathtaking and disturbing. The world is vast, and it seemed that every time I thought I had explored it all, there was still another hidden area to unlock and explore. This amazing world seemed all the bigger, I think, because of how small I felt in it.

I am just an average gamer, no slouch but nothing to brag about either. My early experience in the game involved dying (a lot) to very basic enemies. I crept slowly through every cave and dungeon, constantly on guard for wolves and imps waiting to jump out at me. When I encountered my first dungeon boss, I probably fought and died a hundred times, determined to beat it (not realizing at the time that I was just too weak, underleveled for the fight, and really should have moved on and come back later). It was frustrating, but I loved the world and I was determined to explore it all.

So... should you play? It is an excellent game on many levels, and I can attest that it is accessible (with a learning curve) to gamers new to the genre. That said, I would only recommend Elden Ring if you have patience and can emotionally tolerate repeated failure. While the open world design offers more freedom to avoid the hardest fights until you've leveled up, there are still some very challenging enemies that can take multiple attempts to defeat. If getting killed by the same boss for the twentieth time might make you punch your screen, maybe look elsewhere.

But if you are willing to learn and grow from defeat, and especially if you love exploring vast new worlds, then I hope you take a chance and journey into the Lands Between. Elden Ring is an experience you likely won't forget anytime soon.",2023-03-07 03:48:50,True,0,0,True,False,104,7,60086,3095,60086,2023-03-05 09:24:34,479,0.7883,positive,2 stars,0.4914424518744151

I was close to skipping it altogether, but my friends convinced me to give it a shot with the Seamless Co-Op mod last month. Although we didn't make much progress as a group, I had a blast finishing the game solo.

Even though I started playing Elden Ring a year after its release, I believe that it was worth the full price of admission. I had some issues with the game's pacing, particularly with regards to the open-world exploration, but the stunning landscapes and compelling lore made the journey worthwhile.

Not to mention one of the main super important bosses (godrick) gets re-used in his first phase as an evergaol boss? That's just goofy as all can be. The game would've been a lot better if it was smaller for sure. As places like the mountaintop of giants and concentrated snowfields aren't fun to explore. Hell you can't even see in most of the snow fields to actually explore the area. Also. The haligree tree is genuinely such a pain in the arse. I had more trouble getting to melania then fighting her? I don't know. I just cannot reccomend this game as the last half is just not fun at all. Atleast a lot of the big bosses were fun.

126,134210109,"One of the greatest games ever. Beautiful sprawling open world that gives the sense of freedom, adventure, and danger we felt gaming as children. The first 40-50 hours of this game are pure unadulterated art. It's rare an open world game makes me *want* to explore, but the mystery danger and lack of markers in Elden Ring had me checking everywhere. Several absolute banger ""dungeon"" levels. 

Combat is tight and responsive, weapons have a weight that feels appropriate for their size. There are a variety of different builds, styles, and choices based on personal preference and skill. The game even includes Ash Summons which can help new players wade their toes into the water of souls games. 

The game stumbles a bit near the end especially with tuning on some fights, but even then has a few of my favorite fights that really help it get over the finish line as a top 5 all time for me. Dark Souls 1 had a similar issue with its post O&S content, and if I can forgive that, I can certainly forgive this one when it throws several of its best fights near the end. There's even a JRPG style super boss that anyone with any familiarity at all with the series is well aware of, given she tells you her name each of the hundreds of times she will kill you

154,134205492,"As many have said, it's quite an adventure and definitely worth playing for souls fans and anyone who likes a true action rpg. It's certainly not a 10/10, but not for lack of content. In fact, the game would've benefited from a few features/areas being cut.

There is easily a full game's worth of unique content here, looking at the scale of the world, the number of areas, weapons/spells, and bosses. However, a lot of the content is repeated to the extent that the game is the scope of 2 or 3 full games. So instead of a normal-sized game where everything is unique and has a purpose, the game has a lot of re-used content and is a bit bloated. So after the 80-ish hour mark, the scope of the game actually works against itself, in my opinion.

The first 40 or 50  hours are sheer bliss and rival my best experiences playing almost any other game, but it falls off bit by bit as you explore more of the worlds areas, finding nearly identical catacombs or caves, consumables that just have a different coat of paint, the same ruined churches/enemies, and mini bosses that are re-used over and over with slight alterations or coupled with other enemies for increased challenge.

enemy and item placement is generally fantastic, and i always felt like the developers were right next to me, watching me play and placing everything by hand. So even when the content is re-used, exploring is still pretty engaging because there are very few empty dead ends.

The overall narrative is intriguing, but any actual explanation of the characters/world/who you are/etc are pushed so far to the sidelines that my biggest bit of positive feedback on this front is that it doesn't get in the way of the experience. And I'm absolutely forced to mention that characters' names are just unbearably similar, I really have no idea what they were thinking here. They took so many liberties with the narrative that they seem to have said to themselves ""it's probably better if it just doesn't make any sense and leaves the world in a state of mystery."" I'm not sure I agree.

I'm tempted to say that the core systems (that is, the combat, menus, and upgrades) are excellent, but honestly there are some big holes in the experience that I can't overlook. It's difficult to summarize, but certain aspects of the game are too obscure considering how critical they are to the whole of the experience. Magic is a great example, as summons, incantations, and sorcery and more are all handled differently and are obscure enough that I wouldn't blame players for skipping most of these mechanics entirely. Sorcery in particular involves finding a specific NPC in the world that is hidden in a copy-paste hole in the ground that could EASILY be overlooked given the size of the world. Summons are granted through the use of an item which is obtained through an NPC that only appears during one part of the game's day/night cycle (which influences very few other parts of the game afaik), and incantations require equipping and using ""seals,"" which is not very obvious. All these things and more are likely explained/hinted at early in the experience but given how much is thrown at you, it's impossible for all of it to stick.

Although it's sort of magical how every game mechanic is veiled in an in-world name (Runes = XP, Ashes of War = special skills for weapons, ""Tears"" are health flask upgrades, etc), this makes for a very, very laborious process of trying to figure out if an item is even important or not. Speaking of importance, consumables make up a lot of the loot in the game, and in a game where the biggest challenges is bosses which will regain all their health when you die, consumables seem meaningless to me. My first 5 attempts at the more difficult bosses will just be learning attack patterns.

Crafting is pointless because you only craft one-time-use consumables which I've already stated that I find useless. Crafting should've been excluded entirely from the game but I'd guess it was left in as an additional incentive to explore/revisit ares of the map.

'Questing' is executed poorly enough to be a considerable net negative on the experience. NPCs appear in different places seemingly at random and the world is simply too big for this too be acceptable, especially without a questlog of some sort. 

There are a few types of loot that I was always happy to find: Smithing Stones (used to upgrade weapons), Talismans (usually stat modifiers that can be easily swapped out to sort of re-spec your character on the fly), armaments/armor, and Runes. Every other bit of loot was almost always pointless and I would shrug and say to myself, ""well, exploring and killing enemies is its own reward. 

Talismans are great and maybe one of my favorite systems in the game. XP and weapons/gear are pretty straightforward, as loot at least. Smithing Stones, however, change the game in an important way that I love and hate, and ultimately wish was different. Upgrading weapons means that you can stick to certain weapons long after they should be obsolete, which is good in that you can use your favorite weapons for most of the playthrough, but because some weapons are so much better in terms of DPS than others, i found myself using only 3 different weapons during 90% or more of my 160 hours. There are an insane number of interesting weapons, so it's a shame that I never saw a path to success by trying lots of different ones. Smithing stones are also a pain-point in that finding a specific 'level' of stone is required to upgrade each stage of the weapons' power. what this means, is that at times, A level 7 smithing stone may be more valuable than an 8 or 9, simply because your weapon's upgrade is gated at each level and you might have run out of 7's. Still, smithing stones are always an exciting find and make exploring fun.

I'm not going to say much about the visuals; in terms of asthetics the game is an easy 10/10. It's truly a breathtaking game and I can't count how many times I said to myself during my playtime ""wow. I've never seen anything like that before.""

Audio is great, OST is pretty spectacular and the music always matches the tone of the situation it accompanies.

Last thing I want to cover is bosses, which are sort of a mixed bag. I'm not surprised this is a big point of contention for the community; some of them are very fun once you get the hang of their moveset, while others are just simply too cruel and unfair to be enjoyable or satisfying once you've conquered them. Almost every boss requires carefully timed dodges and a mastery of stamina management and character building. That's fine. What really isn't fine is bosses reading player inputs to trigger attacks the exact moment you do something, bosses that track perfectly, forcing dodge rolls instead of just clever footwork, absurdly long combos, Multiple boss phases, incorrect or very sloppy hit boxes and one hit kills. A boss could have one or two of the above and still be a fair fight, but I'd say the majority of the main bosses (and quite a few of the minibosses) have most or all of those features. I'm not saying any of the bosses aren't possible with time and effort, I'm saying a lot of them aren't very fun. Given the various types of character builds, the length of the game, and the fact that co-op is potentially part of the experience, I think the devs erred on the side of making bosses too overpowered, unfair, or tedious. If fighting bosses was less common I might give this a pass, but such a large percent of my playtime was spent in boss encounters (often fighting a new boss immediately after beating a previous one), that I really just got tired of the experience and wanted it to end.

Now, this review has mostly focused on the negative features of the game, but I think the positives more than make up for it. This is really a breathtaking epic experience that, despite being flawed, is definitely worth a recommendation. Game of the Year?

169,134202824,"So many amazing things were achieved with Elden Ring, and although its undeniably a masterpiece and genius in terms of world building and design. There are significant issues that might ruin the game for a lot of the player base, especially on subsequent play-through's. 

With the exception of Godrick being a near perfect boss in terms of gameplay and design aesthetic. The boss quality of Elden Ring doesn't match up to their previous titles, Dark Souls 3 notably. Pretty much every main story boss in the game has at least one attack or more that is unreactable or purely unfair, with the end game bosses being the biggest offenders. But I will say that even though this may be an issue in terms of game design, Elden Ring is probably the easiest game Fromsoft has made given all the resources that are offered to you in game.

Upon first play-through, someone might not have a problem running through the many side dungeons in the game because the act of finding a secret in the world adds spectacle, but this also has to do with the fact that most players wont know that the layouts and enemies used in these dungeons are reused over and over again, with little nuance. The side dungeons in Elden Ring are basically just the chalice dungeons from Bloodborne but worse; because Instead of getting something useful as a reward from a chalice dungeon like you would in Bloodborne, because of the extreme build diversity in Elden Ring, you are going to get something completely useless to your specific build ninety percent of the time. In addition to the side dungeons, certain bosses like the Ulcerated Tree Spirit are reused at least 10 times if you go through the trouble to find them all. Fromsoft has handled reusing bosses in the past very well but it isn't done well here. With all this in mind you might think that, ""Well maybe you're only SUPPOSED to have one good play-through."". But this just isn't the case when you factor in the sheer number of different builds and weapons you can use and the fact it has a New Game + option.  

Considering the many flaws this game has, it doesn't stop this game from being one of the best games I have ever played. And without any of these flaws, Elden Ring would be undeniably one of the best games ever made. But it might still be up there even with its flaws. 

So maybe I just typed all of this out for zero reason.

Being this my second playthrough, now on PC, im surprised im still having a BLAST playing this again.

The first time you enter the Lands between, it's a magical experience as the world is full of things to discover, hidden paths that lead to places you already visited or not, or even get teleported into the skies.

There is nothing quite like this game in the sense that the world is carefully crafted to the tinniest detail.

There are no screen overlays or bread crumb trails telling you what to do next. or even where to go otherwise have to learn Whether deciphered from in-game italic item descriptions or gathered from the precious internet community. Death is not so much an avoidable setback as a necessary provision on the path to enlightenment. It might sound scary in theory. But in practice it's exciting.

259,134176218,"Great game, maybe it's my souls bias. most bosses are fun ( mohg is kinda stupid with that phase 2 transformation which just forces you to heal, with no way of avoiding the damage. I would be fine with that if it just healed him, but the fact that it forces you to take damage with no way around it IMO is straight donkey cock.) there are a couple I have problems with, mad pumpkin is my favorite of all the bosses I have fought(But my actual favorite boss is melania, Phase 1 is a breeze. Sure the health regain is a tough punish to deal with but with patients its not that hard to dodge and weave around her. Phase 2 though was extremely hard[atleast for me] she was faster and the bloom got me way more than it should, my stupid ass just running into it. had to fight the camera lock sometimes cause she would fly off my screen.Probably took me around 30 attempts to kill the cretonne.) . The exploration is really fun and is what got me to spend so much time in the game, cool environments rewarding you for searching them thoroughly while having secrets and alternate paths for most of the venture. Don't have too much to say about the normal mobs the populate the world, due to the fact that I just run past them to go straight to the end of what ever dungeon or area I happen to be in. Just do not really feel rewarded fighting them, their pretty hollow. The story was fun to follow although a confusing mess since its open world and I had no straight linear path to follow. All in all considered I think this game sits at my 6th favourite in my list of games.

270,134171070,"hidetaka miyazaki and george r. r. martin created a beautiful world with a vast history and mythology. if you like the politics and characters of a song of ice and fire, lord of the rings, and/or the witcher, you will enjoy this universe. there are some amazing lore videos  on yt about elden ring and the lands between. if you delve into the lore i promise your game experience will be elevated! it feels like i learn something new every time i play. 
i've had the most fun playing builds and with items i think are cool. there are so many options that pretty much any build is possible. the game is mostly easy with help from co-op. if you want to challenge yourself play solo or with summons for a bit, but try online play because it is really fun. you can go at your own pace and do most things in any order you want. you can gain as many levels as you want to make your play through easier or give yourself a level cap to make the final boss fights more difficult. i think this game gets better each time i play and the more hours i commit to it.
ultimately, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes history, mythology, mysteries, likes to learn, dark souls/bloodborne/sekiro, and/or games where choices are important. i think if you want a game to put 1,000 hours into, this is a great choice.

The biggest flaw imo is the repeated assets. While the world and enemies are still diverse overall, if you explore everything you will notice some similar mini-dungeons and repeat enemies (most notable is when you see the same side/mini-boss again). Did you think 3 asylum demons in dark souls was too many? Well now there are a dozen!  HOWEVER, even if this brings the game down a bit for you, you will probably still have a lot of fun with it.

ONE MORE THING. Please don't let anyone tell you how you are ""supposed"" to play the game. One of the best parts of Souls games is the diversity of tools available to you, and the ability to make the game as easy or difficult as you want depending on how you play it.

I had to put the game down for about a year, returned to it to beat it... and that is good enough for me (even with the tempting thought of new game+'s). 

This was my first ever souls-like game and will probably be my last; that isn't to say the game isn't great. The world is massive, has detailed stories when you actually look for it, and the spells/weapon skills are fun to use.

383,134153761,"I'm not even really a souls guy but the last game that made me feel this way was Skyrim. The way there's literally always something just ahead to investigate. The way the reward for doing so isn't just a Korok seed or whatever (until it is, but then you read a note saying ""Why is it always mushroom?"" and it *feels* like you were rewarded, even when you weren't). The way every individual region of the world is just teeming with art direction and high fantasy imagery. The way the enemy designs are so interesting you flirt with death just to see the whole moveset. The high number of equipment items that all look genuinely unique. 

One of the things that turned me off about souls games in the past was that if I lost my souls I felt like I had to grind back through an area I already completed to get them back or I'd be underleveled for the boss. I've never once had that feeling in Elden Ring. In part because the spawns are a bit more forgiving (directly in front of a boss room, for example), but also because of the fundamental gameplay design changes that come from it being open world. I'd go into it, but I'd rather get back to playing.

Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,

and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish.

Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.

The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.

A war from which no lord arose.

A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.

Arise now, ye Tarnished.

Ye dead, who yet live.

The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.

Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands.

The ever-brilliant Goldmask.

Fia, the Deathbed Companion.

The loathsome Dung Eater.

And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.

And one other. Whom grace would again bless.

A Tarnished of no renown.

Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.

Insane balancing issues, some annoying level and quest design, fucked up parkour, clunky movement, some boring and repeated bosses...
But god damn, I liked this game a lot
My enjoyment came not from combat, but the exploration and character building
It felt like everything I explored contributed to my strength, even though it didn't really

I only hit two walls:
- Margit, because I was severely unprepared and unskilled
- Malenia, counting 80 actual tries, the only time I broke my self imposed rules

I put some restrictions on my run a little after Margit:
Solo, No summons, No consumables, No Rune Arcs, No guarding, Heavy affinity only
Even so, the game felt easy with my heaviest armor / STR only / Colossal Sword build

Played the Grafted Sword for more than half of the game, and the other half was basically the Greatsword
I wanted to try other weapons, but those felt like they were the best options I had for my build
Smithing should have been more affordable to give room for experimentation

The story went right above my head, I have no idea what was going on
I only knew I had to kill, and boy, did I kill
Only character I grew attached to was Hewg, the blacksmith, who I liked a lot for reasons unbeknownst to me

Killed all the bosses and saw the Ranni and Fractured endings
Failed most quests because wiki gaming sucks

546,134110798,"I'm just going to go over gameplay and the world because I don't hold any opinions anywhere else.

This is first of all just a combat focused game, it's open world dark souls and it is what you would expect. There are no mini games, no towns, there's one little guild you run into and very rarely do you come across someone or something not hostile. Your traversal options are mostly being just grounded with the situational high jump being granted to you. You can't swim, fly, or glide. The game has A LOT of abilities and gear to collect, and it starts you off well with classes to go into and from there you can just start setting goals of what you want to tackle with guidance or experience. Playing blind can be a bit frustrating if you're exploring for rewards and not strictly for challenge because you may not find something that suits your class. The enemy variety is insane, there's also a lot of traps in this game inside dungeons, so check your surroundings. Also make sure you follow the tutorial all the way through to get the basics of the game unlocked, don't try to go gallivanting after you step out into the world, follow the light. The game has some balancing issues, magic is very strong, bleed is very strong. I never found much use for crafting, but I heard it's a bit helpful. The combat is sluggish compared to other action games and the enemy attacks are sometimes strangely fast and relentless as if they should be in Sekiro instead, trying to pick your moments with melee can be frustrating unless you use summons, which are also broken (especially mimic tear) because they distract the AI. Lastly, co-op in this game is a tragedy because people can invade you.

Positives:

-Lots of enemy variety

560,134105769,"elden ring is elden mid
it’s not a flawed masterpiece or a rough diamond or whatever else the meme 2 hour video essays tell you, it’s just mid
DISCLAIMER: this is my second time playing this game, don't mind the hours, the first time i was doing the hand hook and eyepatch build

>open world
probably the best aspect of this game by far, you just can never get tired of exploring the lands between
one complaint about the open world i often hear is that you often find yourself just traveling way too much from point a to point b, but i don’t see this as a negative, since the game’s beauty alone is enough to keep your attention 
legacy dungeons are also good but that’s been said a million times already 
however, even this kind of open world is not without flaws

>copy paste
why does this game have 5 or so dungeon types?
no, i don’t want to explore yet another cave or a mine or some lazily copy pasted catacombs (sometimes with a chariot), but sometimes you have to, to get the smithing stones or that talisman you want
but it’s not just the dungeons that get copy pasted, bosses and enemies do too
can you imagine my disappointment when i got to the mountaintops of giants and was like ""holy, this area is so beautiful, i wonder what kind of enemies i'll be fighting in here""
can you imagine my face when i saw the caelid dogs, the caelid birds, the stormveil birds, the demi-humans, the bats, the marionettes, the hands, and the vulgar militiamen
a-at least zamor dudes became a normal enemy instead of a m-mini-boss, so it's at least ONE unique enemy tied to this area, r-right?
miyazaki, my brother in christ, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THESE ANNOYING BIRDS AND BATS AND DOGS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME, I’VE KILLED SO MANY OF THE DEFAULT SWORD/SPEAR SOLDIERS, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD MORE ENEMIES INTO THE GAME
NO, YOU CAN’T JUST PASTE OLD ENEMIES FROM OLD GAMES, YOU DID THAT TWICE IN ELDEN RING ALREADY WITH ASYLUM DEMON AND CAPRA DEMON
i am especially sick of the copy pasted dragons, erdtree avatars are at least fun to fight
ROT DRAGON, ICE DRAGON, NORMAL DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON 2
ALL OF THEM HAVE THE SAME MOVESET
this is a triple a game, just to remind you
edit: there is way more copy paste from previous titles as it turns out, just today i found out about red wolf of radagon having the same animations as sif and the death blight frogs

>combat
this is where things get bad, such outdated souls-tier combat where it feels like you’re handling a bus instead of a human SHOULD NOT EXIST with such fast bosses that feel like they come straight out of sekiro
either make the player faster and give him more movement options, or make the bosses slower
it is infuriating having to dodge 5-10 boss attacks only to get ONE hit in and then repeat the cycle
torrent is awful to control, and it feels like he's not listening to half my commands
wow, it's just like a real horse!
the decision to make your stamina tied to torrent's is also bizarre and unexplainable
also, input buffering is more often then not the result of your character’s demise, as it has been countless times that this trash read my ash of war as ash of war + left handed attack after it and i died so many times because of this
before fromdrones shout “skill issue”, i am literally putting my hands off the keyboard after doing the ash of war and my character still does the normal attack after it
but, despite that, my character drinks only 1 flask half the time despite me mashing the heal button
i often miss the opportunity to reposte thanks to INPUT BUFFERING, so why not let the player know when the boss stagger is coming up?
you're gonna make a posture break mechanic without implementing at least some kind of sign?
i swear to christ miyazaki has never played his own games
also, why do the enemies' arrows home in on you, yet the player's arrows don't home in on enemies?
do the enemies have special magnet arrows or something?
can some lore expert tell me how this is explained in the story?

>bosses
and these bosses, oh god, these bosses
delayed attacks, input reads (these are especially “fun” if you’re doing any run that involves projectiles), blatant destruction of established game mechanics, they got everything you don’t want in an action rpg
and i can't stress enough how awful the input reads are, the best bosses for showcasing such nonsense are margit for his combo extender that he won't do unless you attack and the godskins who shoot black flames at you IMMEDIATELY upon pressing the heal button
someone needs to teach miyazaki that's not how reaction time works
but, being completely honest, i had fun fighting malenia
sure, she is actually one to break established mechanics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Vbsr3Ko7M
but at least that boss has a unique feel and dynamic to it, akin to an old samurai standoff, where the two warriors exchange blows and then fall back to circle around each other
her attacks are more or less intuitive, and she does have a flexible moveset that’s fun to play around with on your part
EXCEPT FOR WATERFOWL DANCE AND VAMPIRISM, WHOEVER DESIGNED THOSE INTO MALENIA NEEDS TO GET FIRED FROM THEIR JOB ASAP, AND UNLESS YOU’VE NOT DONE SOMETHING AS ELEMENTARY AS BEATING MALENIA ON A KEYBOARD WITH NO SUMMONS OR SLEEP POTS OR MOONVEIL/ROB, YOUR OPINION DOES NOT COUNT
also, elden beast is the worst final boss in any video game ever, radagon was such a good conclusion to this mediocre, but still charming game, but nope, my face gets smeared with the broken unfun mess that is elden beast
he's constantly running away, he's not at all dynamic like radagon, and he even looks like crap
come on, who wants to fight a giant space spaghetti as the final boss?
also, ulcerated tree spirit
just ulcerated tree spirit

>story
average fromsoft fan be like:
OH MY SCIENCE IS THAT LE HECKING MIYAZAKI TELLING THE LORE OF THE GAME THROUGH ITEM DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE 1488TH TIME??? HOLY GOSH OOOOOOOOOOO ELDEN RING
seriously though, the lore of this game is admittedly pretty interesting, but the narrative sucks
to give an example, in the beginning we are shown a literal powerpoint presentation about the world
okay, what’s the night of the black knives?
not gonna explain?
oh, okay
i’m a tarnished?
i don’t even understand what that means
what the hell is an elden ring?
and so on and so forth
stuff like this continues throughout the whole game because the narrative feels like a jumbled mess of in-universe terms and seemingly random events
on that note, quest design in this game is unintuitive as hell
to take varre’s quest for instance, how the hell am i supposed to know that i need invade other players THREE times to advance his quest?
or patches, it’s like he’s teleporting around the map at random, he doesn’t tell you where he’s gonna go

>leveling
softcaps?
really?
at least tell the player when they get to them, so he doesn’t have to google it
i suggest this is due to pvp or some crap like that, but pvp is a portion of the game, not the entirety of it and you don’t balance stuff AROUND it
the smithing stone grind in this game is obnoxious because of what i described about the caves in the open world section
such game design is almost ubisoft-tier, and those are the items that actually get you through the game

>optimization
it is just bad
it is understandable why my fps are bad on medium settings, seeing distant lands is part of the charm of this game
but the crashes are inexcusable
i suspect it is due to the botched anti-cheat, since without steam this game didn't run half as bad

IN CONCLUSION
i really cannot recommend this game if you're into the ACTION part of the ACTION RPGs
it's a strong MAYBE if you're into the RPG part, but it's just simply so tiresome to even control your character
this game is just outdated, through and through, and i think we all know why it won goty
it is because there was nothing else better than elden ring
i mean, come on, you're gonna give it to god of soy?

562,134105558,"Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!

Here are the ingredients you will need!

Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.

Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.

Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.


1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.

5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.

6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.

7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.

8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.

9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.

10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",2023-03-05 09:43:24,True,0,0,False,False,402,22,1836,1803,742,2023-03-07 11:26:32,543,0.9556,positive,5 stars,0.36483385662237805

575,134100850,"THE GOOD: 

* New open world setting.
This works phenomenally, the change from the cramped and claustrophobic gauntlets in older Fromsoft titles to open plains in the Lands Between feels amazing. The freedom of engaging the world at your own pace is such a wonderful introduction. The areas introduced all feel unique with it's own stories to tell. 

*A fantastic, intricate and engaging lore. 
How can we describe the story and lore of Elden Ring? Well, I'd say Early Christianity, western alchemy, Gnosticism, occultism and mysticism. The historical foundation that serves as a base for the game's storytelling has been greatly expanded compared to earlier titles and is now bigger than ever. This makes this game such a joy to unravel, puzzling together the historical references. 

*Stunning and unparalleled visuals
This game offers some of the most stunning colors, weathers and atmospheres I've seen in a game. Each zone has it's own unique climate, flora and color palette that it nails perfectly. From the ever-clouded plains of Limgrave, the starry skies of Liurnia to the snowy mountaintop of the Giants. 

THE BAD: 
*The game sadly plays too much like an older Dark Souls game
And what I mean by this, despite Elden Ring's adaptation to a more modern open world RPG, it still plays out like the titles of yore. It's a railroaded boss slaying game that offers very limited effects of player choices and world interactions. Many NPCs questlines feature interesting early stages that can be skipped altogether (Rogier, Ranni etc), without any punishment or loss of valuable items. 
It makes the game feel extremely streamlined as it doesn't reward thorough gameplay more akin to a RPG. 

*Limited weapon and armor variety 
My favorite thing about Dark Souls 3 was the absolute variety of gear in the world. 
Soldiers and knights in the Lands Between all carry more or less identical gear. 
The pinhead knight armor having the same model across all factions is disappointing. 
Not to mention they all wield the exact same weapons. The Brass Shield, the Lordsworn Straight- and Greatsword, Knight's Greatsword and Partisan. A world filled with different heritages and traditions should enable a more diverse selection of styles. 

*Low enemy variety 
This somewhat follows in the same track as the previous one, just as we see a lack of variety of gear on enemies, we also have a lack of variety when it comes to enemies. 
What truly makes an area feel unique is it's denizens. Sadly, as we progress to the later stages of the game we can really notice how the enemy variety fizzles out, and in the final zones of the game we end up fighting more or less the same enemies we've fought before, but now they have a lot more HP, defense and attack. That's it. 

*Unfinished and cut content 
""First you should do when you're done writing, is rewriting""

Anyone who followed the initial announcement of Elden Ring probably expected what a rollercoaster the development process must've been. Ultimately, we ended up with a game worthy of the GOTY title, but in the end we can't help but notice how certain things feel missing or incomplete. 
A cross comparison of item descriptions from the 1.00 version of the game reveals fundamentally different lore implications. A plethora of NPCs and questlines have been cut and reworked (Kale and the Great Caravan is one example), and we cannot know for sure what impact that might have had on the original vision of the game. Will these be reworked and reintroduced in expansions? Perhaps, but remember these were NPCs that were supposed to be in the base game (looking at you Rico).


THE VERDICT: 
9/10

Elden Ring is without a doubt one of the best games of the decade. Maybe you think my criticism of the game are silly nitpicks, but for a game of this caliber and quality I do reserve myself the right of taking these observations. 

Ultimately, Elden Ring is an epic unlike anything we've played before, it has truly set a new bar in the gaming industry.  All that I can ask from Fromsoft is to take some steps outside of their Dark Souls comfort zone in the future.

582,134099090,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games I have played such as Skyrim and Far Cry which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses, it truly is up to you with no outside influence. It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game.

Elden Ring has also mastered the art of sublety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the same with Elden Ring. It's hard to place my finger on one specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable. Many times I've gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I belive that it's each of the game's features: its combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc. that complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing and at the same time, come together in such a fluid manner that I as the player can't notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I haven't felt from any game before.

Other, more objective factors of Elden Ring are equally as impressive--it's hard to believe this is a $60 game. The map is massive, far bigger than I could've ever imagined, with more content packed into it than any other world game I've played before. I have not had a single moment where I've felt the map felt desolate or empty, there was always something to see and explore. The combat system is rich, balanced, and rewards each playstyle. The difficulty of the game is refreshing and I feel that I'm being challenged to improve and innovate as I play the game instead of relying on old hacks. The subtle details, such as changes in behavior over time of day or cross-NPC interactions add a layer of immersion that makes the world feel alive. It is also a very polished product: while games today are released with game-breaking bugs and issues, I haven't encountered a single bug in Elden Ring even given its massive map aside from minor visual glitches. It is truly astounding how much that adds to the immersion of the game.

Overall, I feel that Elden Ring is an amazing game. While it isn't perfect by any means, in fact, the imperfections of the game give me something to look forward to for what will be the sequel to this, it will be hard to find a game from the last decade that is as immersive as this. I am truly impressed by From Software's work and I look forward to their next game. Elden Ring will inspire the next generation's set of games and I hope to see what comes from this.

653,134084378,"[h1] Elden Ring is the pinnacle game in the Souls-like genre. Building on the foundations of previous FromSoftware titles, Elden Ring is a standout title and is the spiritual successor to Dark Souls. Elden Ring comes at a great time in a nosediving era of AAA gaming, and is the best new game I’ve played in a few years. [/h1]

Building on the shoulders of Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, Elden Ring seems to bring everything together into an all-encompassing epic which smashes the scale and complexity of previous titles out of the water. Thrust into a new high fantasy/dark fantasy setting, the player is put into a world which dwarfs the map size of previous titles; it’s full of more secrets and treasures than we’ve seen in other FromSoftware titles. Although some open areas are a bit dead, the quality of many of the game’s hubs is enough to overpower these “mile wide, inch deep” areas – including the great mage academy of Raya Lucaria, the game’s first castle in Stormveil Castle, the fiery peak which holds Volcano Manor, and the game’s central location which is the golden multi-leveled city of Leyndell. Of course, there is much more, with several vital, detailed locations spread out across a large world. You’ll find golden forests, caves full of crystals, icy fields and icy peaks, mighty castles, and great underground rivers. Speaking of underground areas, Elden Ring’s underground areas are less like dinky caves and are more like entire world spaces, complete with lost ancient cities, mighty bosses, and dark or mysterious secrets – for me, this may have been one of the most standout parts of Elden Ring. This is almost like if Zork was given the AAA budget it always needed.

Elden Ring has more quests and storylines than FromSoftware fans have ever seen, and it has several distinct endings. Elden Ring has a story that is fairly easier to interpret than past FromSoftware titles, yet I would argue it is also more open to interpretation in general, and has quest progression that is quite complex. Quests, especially main story quests, have several steps to follow, which may not always be stated explicitly. The game’s many endings each have different steps to achieving any specific ending, where these steps may run through different and separate areas of the world entirely – your only hints may be on an obscure item description, or just happening to find a NPC in the perfect specific place. When you consider this alongside the fact that a full playthrough of Elden Ring can easily take over 100 hours, it becomes clear that this game is intended for those who will truly explore every detail of the world. This game will require serious exploring, item description reading, and a deal of abstract thinking. You should know that there is no quest log at all, which only adds to the vagueness of quest progression.

In essence, the game is a massive riddle and puzzle – whether this is all a problem or not is up to you. It may mean missing out on entire quest lines and important characters or bosses, or it may mean finding secrets which few have found organically. This notable challenge is not helped by the game’s infamously harder-than-average combat – but, for me, if it’s not that hard then it’s not even worth playing.

Elden Ring is a darn difficult game to play through. A third-person fast-flowing M&M (magic and melee), Elden Ring’s combat system allows the player to dodge, evade, block, and counterattack in many ways, where each element must be timed very well – and, where small miscalculations can mean an easy end. While the game features some difficulty-reducing facets such as fast travel, a horse to ride on, and several opportunities to grind for skills, levels, and weapon upgrades, the bosses are still quite difficult to pass through, especially a few of the late game bosses. The fanbase may argue on who has the biggest stick among the FromSoftware games, but I kid you not – it’s far from a breeze. You must be on your toes at every second, and you must learn almost all of your enemy’s moves to persist and persevere. I thought Elden Ring’s late game was more hair-tugging than any of the other Souls-like games so far, and when it can be a 100 hour game you must steel yourself for far longer than your average game. This game is meant for people who desire a serious challenge, or at least is meant for those who can tolerate a serious challenge, although of course it can be cheesed if you so desire.

If you want to be pushed and shoved until you’re any good, and then still want to be pushed and shoved beyond that, this game is up your alley.

As a Dark Souls fan, it is time for me to admit that, deep down, I think Elden Ring is simply the better title now. Elden Ring’s quality has surpassed the older titles – there, I said it. In addition, I think this game is the best fantasy title in many years, and it has taken a jump beyond contemporary and established fantasy series.

If we’re looking a bit deeper into the storytelling and themes of Elden Ring, the concept of ambition appears frequently throughout the game, which could lead to one of many interpretations from the game: “life is what you make it”. While you could look at this for the very concept of “truth” itself, in my own subjective way I take it to mean “the world is my oyster”. A pinch of inspiration followed by a mountain of hard work may get us to the sea beyond the mountain, where our coveted oyster’s pearl lies. Ambition must be followed primarily by dedication, persistence, a Spartan’s courage, and a life of tough work to get to anywhere of meaning. While ambition alone is never enough, it is the dire lifeblood that builds empires, discovers worlds, and creates new kings. It is the very thing which underpins the motivations of Elden Ring’s characters, and which powers those of any value in the real world in front of us. For me, it is like a third lung or a second heart, while those without ambition are but a kite fluttering in the wind with its strings cut off – lost, without real direction, defeatist, and will remain in all flavors of mediocrity until they are dust in the wind.

“A man’s worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.”
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Still, this is just one interpretation of Elden Ring, when it may also seem there isn’t only one true interpretation from this game. From another philosophical perspective, I think Elden Ring may highlight a great point which is lost in many minds, especially within Western philosophy: there is not, or at least may not be, one universal truth or narrative, or at least that the concept of “universal truth” is subjective, with several coexisting “truths” or narratives happening at once. Some would probably pick this thought apart on the semantics of “is not” versus “may not be”, and moralists or objectivists would have a field day on the latter parts of that sentence, but frankly I don’t care. For me, Elden Ring mainly embodies these concepts within its several endings, as it may leave breadcrumbs but will never suggest any one truth or narrative for you. With what you may see later on in the game, you might see multiple truths and narratives taking place at the same time.

What is “truth”? What is “free”? Who decides what “truth” is? Who gets to rule? Who enforces “truth”? Who may be free? These are many of the questions posed by Elden Ring – questions which are not objectively answered and which are left to your own devices. The minds of FromSoftware and Westeros aficionado George R.R. Martin come together in a very interesting way, and offer several competing, separate philosophies to analyze.

[b] Elden Ring is the capstone project of FromSoftware, and is one of the few great AAA games in recent years. With more of Elden Ring still to come, it will be hard for a game like this to get beaten anytime soon, and it’s a great new addition to the fantasy genre.

In fact it works perfectly and add in all the RPG elements from leveling , gearing, and other additional systems along with the combat and you have a deep game with plenty of exploration. The game is massive you'll never be bored playing it and leveling is just fun while the combat is challenging / rewarding. Also you can JUMP which is huge in a fromsoftware game.

761,134059955,"The best souls game for me by far. I've played every single souls game since DS1 but this game takes the crown for me. I've heard a lot of people have an issue with the lore and what not but I'm the opposite, I think the lore is great and the setting is what does it for me. I think this game is going to be either an S tier or an A+ tier for you depending on how much you like this style of game. The game is a souls like game but with a heavy emphasis on ""open world"", which IMO is amazing and there should be more of this. I'm a big enjoyer of these open world games so for me it was an easy S tier maybe even S+ with the DLC when it comes out. Most people who criticize this game are used to the classic souls like experience where you just follow a set guideline and stay on it, meanwhile this game throws that out of the water and lets you go anywhere you want whenever you want. I already beat the game once just rushing through it and even then it was extremely fun. The game has lots of replay ability and some people have even 10+ replays, every time you discover something new and different than your previous play-through. Right now I'm doing my 100% play-through, meaning I discover and do every single thing the game, get every single weapon, talisman, etc. I think this is the way to go in terms of playing the game and brings the most out of it, very fun game and definitely recommend it even for the somewhat steep $60.",2023-03-04 18:13:20,True,0,0,True,False,77,13,3818,2194,3153,2023-03-07 06:28:56,284,0.9943,positive,5 stars,0.6846009095509847

794,134052850,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Elden Ring and in less than a week, he had already played for over 28 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do.

807,134048361,"Alright folks, this is Donald Trump here, and I want to talk about Elden Ring. Now let me tell you, this game is tremendous, okay? It's like nothing you've ever seen before.

First off, the graphics are beautiful. The colors are so vibrant, it's almost like you're really there. And the gameplay, it's phenomenal. You're fighting dragons, battling evil monsters, and exploring vast landscapes. It's like the Wild West of video games.

Let me just say, the creator of this game, Hidetaka Miyazaki, he's a genius. He's created something truly special here. And the music, it's fantastic. You'll feel like you're in the middle of a movie with the way the score builds and falls.

Now, I know some people might be hesitant to try this game because it's a little bit hardcore. But trust me, if you give it a chance, you won't regret it. Don't listen to those fake news critics who say it's too hard, they just don't have what it takes to conquer Elden Ring.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a winner. It's a game for winners, okay? If you're looking for an adventure that will test your skills, then look no further.

849,134031642,"Overall a great game of course, but experienced soured quite a bit during later parts. So currently I am not in the mood for getting other endings, expansions or other From Soft games. While sites of grace are more generously placed than in Dark Souls from what I remember, I still got annoyed the times I had to run more than 2 minutes and re-instate all buffs over and over and over again for some bosses. Meagre loot combined with the rune loss mechanics is not fun. Don't really ever again want to fight another Crucible Knight, Maliketh, Radagon or Elden Beast. Besides that, the game is just too long. I recorded 140 hours and then I still skipped some chunks of the map entirely. With that out of my system, the only fair grade for Elden Ring is a, perhaps weak, 5/5. It's eased up enough to motivate even me, a non-fan of From Soft games, to keep going.

859,134027166,"Quite literally the best soulsborne game I have ever played. And I should know, I've been playin' them all since Demon Souls.

This title combines the best of the best when it comes to the amount of choices of play, and is probably the best place for someone to start with the series due to the game being open world, enabling players who are stuck with one thing to go to another and eventually slowly learn as they go. And for returning players, they'll find familiar weapons and mechanics, plus all new ones leading into some really interesting styles of play. 

My only complaint with this game: Due to the game being open world like it is, it is rather difficult to continue and very easy to completely miss some NPC quests and stories. The game is still completely enjoyable without doing them all, of course, as this is the kind of game that encourages players to play it multiple times to really experience what the game has to offer, and if you're really desperate then you can always consult a guide online these days.

I highly recommend this game, and consider it in the realms of 10/10. Great music, beautiful awe-inspiring environments, wild creature and character design, an absolute ludicrous level of freedom. If you must play a singular souls game in your life time, this is the one I recommend. And that's just the base game alone, we'll see just how much better this game is when the dlc arrives! This game is well worth the base price, but I understand if you'd rather wait for a sale.

This is a PvE-single-player-explore-and-conquer dream.  But I don't recommend it.  It is frustratingly difficult at times.  The story is non-existent.  There are no quest guides to help you navigate the open world.  I am playing the game with a 12900k + 4090 yet it frequently stutters during combat, even though it's weirdly locked to 60 FPS.  My 2017 7700k + 1080 Ti could do 4k60 so ... what gives?

This game feels a lot like Elder Scrolls games: sure there's a main questline / goal but you can totally ignore it and just wander around and do stuff.  I never finished Oblivion or Skyrim; I wandered around, leveled up, did some quest lines, joined some guilds, then got bored and stopped playing altogether.

Elden Ring has been similar ... I'm 160+ hours in and have leveled a lot and explored but now feel fatigue & boredom.  Since there's no story development, I don't feel any connection to the world and the characters in it ... why do I even care about becoming the Elden Lord and stopping the baddies in this world?  Since there are no quest markers, I often find NPCs dead (as evidenced by them being a pile of lootable armor) having missed meeting them at the correct time.  But, I usually just shrug at this because the game doesn't give me a reason to care.

I think it's the definition of bullshit. On the elden beast it does this thing where it shoots stars from the sky that track you and it's very annoying, and how i've gotten past that on every single play-through i've done is by running, that's what your supposed to do. But that doesn't matter. Because every single time i get it down to super low health it won't even let me avoid the attack anymore. i've been stuck on elden beast for 5 hours and without fail this only happens when it gets to low health, every other time i can get past it easy no sweat.

1013,133995368,"ELDEN RING

I wanted to be objective on this review so I left it for some while and waited for my excitement to go down. Fromsoftware and their games are my favourites. I love Souls-Borne series the most of all games.
I started with Dark Souls 2 and after it played through Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Sekiro. DS1 and Demon Souls I saw on the live stream. 
Then I played an absurd amount of souls-like games from other studios or indie developers, for example: Surge 1+2, Hellpoint, Lords of the Fallen, Nioh 1+2, Ashen, Mortal Shell, Salt and Sanctuary, Code Vein, Thymesia, Death's Gambit etc.
The point is I love the souls like formula in the games and all these games that I mentioned are great but I wanted something fresh, because all of these game follows the same pattern. 
When Elden Ring was first announced I thought of it as no big deal, but man was I wrong.

Elden Ring took the souls formula and pushed it to another level - open world. It could sound terrifying but it isn't, trust me. The masters from Fromsoftware did absolutely amazing job in implementing all that we like into an open world. The world is full of activities, enemies, bosses, items (every one item except consumables has its own specific place), NPCs and stories and full of amazing lore that we love. The game challenges you at every corner and I thought not even once that I'm bored. Worlds on Ubisoft ""checklist"" basis are nothing compared to the world of Elden Ring.

Build variety is as amazing, maybe better than in Dark Souls. Main dungeons are sweet and complex locations like in the previous games. Side dungeons are okey, sometimes they look similar to each other, but it depend on ""biome"" in which you currently are. There are lot of secret tombs and theres questline for witch Ranni, that opens a whole area of the map that you cannot find otherway. Skills, spells, weapons feel epic and adds a lot of flavour to your playthrough.

It's a fresh wind for souls games and I hope the coming DLC would be even better than the main storyline.

Pros and cons:
+ Amazing open world
+ It feels like Dark Souls but better
+ Graphics are slightly better but nothing big, so I felt like home from the beggining
+ Epic bosses, even better than in previous games (I mean main bosses)
+ Great lore and exploration

- It's not ideal for a newbies to souls games

Peaks a little early in my opinion, the first half of the game feels like a true adventure with challenging difficulty and new content around every corner, but once you reach the halfway point, some of the content starts to feel a bit stale and a bit easy if you're using all the tools the game gives you.

That being said, it's a fantastic game, and probably the most complete/polished game From has ever put out.

These are some of the first words you will hear in Elden Ring. It plants a mystery in your mind that persists until the very end. I knew right then that this game was something beyond special.

Elden Ring is a difficult game, especially for new-comers like me, who are new to the Souls-series of games, but that did not stop my endless amazement and sense of wonder every step I took. The environments, the bosses, the silent storytelling of the world around me was so.. unique. The more I played, the more I wanted to know, and I fell deep down the rabbit hole of this game's world.

I will never forget the cinematic landscapes you see for each new area, the distant castle walls or giant golden trees. It is truly something you need to experience.

The gameplay itself is quick and tight, the bosses pose interesting challenges that respect your time. Slaying a boss, especially the ones in the main story, feels like you really did something substantial, as often the world changes around you in their absence.

You are only ever given one goal in Elden Ring that truly matters.

1067,133980063,"game is only 50 gigabyte cause they copy-pasted almost everything at least 1 time, every dungeon looks the exact same and even has the same mobs.

its nice to have alot of bosses but maybe they should have made them more interactive and make the animations as big as the hitbox. the last 2 bosses were probably the worst thing i fought in any game ever

very clunky combat system, the animation of not having pots left to drink stuns for about 3 seconds and cant be canceled. about 90 % of the time enemy hits cancel your attack and sometimes your own hits cc for 3 seconds and there seems to be no pattern, putting on 3x better gear against cc didnt make any difference either.

the game is not that bad, offers a lot of content for not too much money but if you play it keep one thing in mind: YOU CAN SKIP BOSSES. some bosses have such poor designs or hitboxes, they dont deserve to die. If you want to just run through i recommend strenght build, its about 50% better than any other build and doesnt even get outscaled in late game despite only leveling vigor and strenght

move on and feel hollow either way
boring af tbh

Serious issues with the pacing of this game. Feel extremely under levelled the entire time
I got how the levelling is supposed to work but the time it takes to go up a single level esp if you want to use strong things that need like 30 in half the stats means you're clearly not meant to be grinding the same enemies to get there because the only farm able enemies give like 11 runes
so the only option is fight and win against whatever is the strongest thing you can find is
and half the time you have no idea if its worth it
you slam your head against this giant whatever for half an hour or more, finally get it and all it gives you is some crafting ingredient and 1k runes, what is point in trying after you get that
meaning the entire game is just getting pummelled by the next OP boss that just shits on you in 0.3 seconds

Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)
The system broken, and the school's closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, ma'fucka, we rollin'
Huh? Ma'fucka, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the mornin'
Huh? I'll see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder

Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation

I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where y'all hiding?
I got the power make your life so exciting
Now this will be a beautiful death

1284,133928592,"I bought Elden Ring shortly after it came out because I missed playing some souls-like, and man was I blown away by how beautiful and well made the game is. 

And HUGE. Oh my... is the map huge. There's just always more and more and more even when you think you've seen it all. 

The addition of horseback riding has definitely been a nice new thing that I know a lot of players are liking. (though I didn't really mind walking in previous games)
I also think spells are probably better and makes more sense now than they have in the past in FromSoftware games. Which is good cause I always found spellcasting to be pretty weird in their games.

The world and its colours are absolutely stunningly beautiful, the bossfights are epic and fun and you have a massive arsenal of weapons and armor to choose from, with 'Ashes of War' to add new abilities. 

Overall with how well made the world is and how much effort you can feel has been put into it I would call Elden Ring a masterpiece and I'll give it like a 9.5/10 

The only downside I have with the game is stuff like quests are still so vague and weird like I think they have always been in FromSoftware soulslike games which is a bit ugh for me and some of my friends. But I know it's kind of in their style at this point. It is just not very appealing in my opinion. 
But you can always just focus on the main storyline in the game and you will still have plenty of stuff to do in this huge world. :)",2023-03-02 19:05:03,True,1,0,True,False,452,36,14351,0,14351,2022-10-28 23:45:32,280,0.9766,positive,5 stars,0.5327603121598562

(Below includes a few details like mechanics, but does not mention any spoilers for major events, locations, or characters)


[Gameplay]

- Freedom of choice -
Choice in Elden Ring is abundant. The game begins with the ability to select a class, each including different armor, weapons, and starting stats. Picking any one of these DOES NOT lock you into a specific playstyle for the rest of the game, they merely give you your choice of starting gear to begin your journey. As you progress, you will be able to find and equip different armor pieces, weapons/combinations of weapons, skills that can be applied to most weapons, and spells/incantations. Despite these being the basics of defense and offense, there are many other ways you can play that include things like sneaking, a flask you can mix ingredients into that have many varying effects, craftable temporary throwing weapons, horseback combat, spirits you can summon into battle, and many more. Most importantly to me, you can use your environment to your advantage such as destroying explosives, knocking enemies off ledges, ambushing, etc. Choice may also be applied to how you finish the game, as there are multiple ending you can achieve in wildly different ways. Some of these endings are straightforward and easy to find, while others I know for a fact I would never have found if I didn't hear about them. Being an open world game, it becomes obvious that you have multiple paths that you can go at any given moment, but Elden Ring does it very well. MOST OF THIS GAME is content that isn't needed to finish the story, and there are entire locations that are hidden off the beaten path with ZERO indication of their existence.

- Difficulty -
It's no secret that this game is difficult. I have played multiple games made by this developer that are just as infamous for their difficulty, and I still had a hard time getting through it. If difficulty is something you don't enjoy, then this might not be the game for you, but I suggest you at least finish reading the rest of this segment. Difficulty in this game does not vary with an ""Easy, Medium, or Hard"" set of modes, but instead, the difficulty comes from choice and circumstance. The playstyle you choose may make some parts of the game more difficult and some more easy. I found that in order to make the game easier or harder comes purely from how you limit yourself. The multiplayer mechanics of this game can mean that you don't have to lift a finger to win this game. Doing a challenge run where you limit yourself in specific ways can make it a run that isn't humanly possible. If you feel that the game isn't hard enough, then you can subtract certain elements of the game to make it a more challenging and fulfilling game. Another thing that makes the game more difficult is after beating the game. When you finish the game, you have the choice to ""Start Journey 2"" which bring your character, armaments, level, and all, to do the story again, but the enemies hurt more and have more HP, but also drop more runes for leveling. Each cycle that you do amplifies these things up until Journey 8, which is as hard as it gets, but you can still restart the game with the same character endlessly if you wish. Benefits of starting a new journey with the same character also include trying new endings, and doing/getting things in case you missed them last time. But if you want the game to be easier for you, you have multiple options. You can summon up to 2 players at a time to aid you or use spirit summons in areas they're allowed. You can also go somewhere else to grind for levels so that you stand a better chance in an area. You can even look up enemy weaknesses if you'd like, as there is a massive community for this game that has knowledge about it all.

- Friends and Foes -
There are multiple ways to interact with other players within the game. The first thing to note is that there aren't other players simply walking around in this open world, but instead, you see messages and bloodstains. The messages are written by other players using a small list of words. These messages can be helpful, funny, pointless, or deceitful, but generally it's a good idea to read them on your journey. Bloodstains can be interacted with to show a red phantom of another player's last moments before death, which can show you how dangerous an area is. White phantoms can sometimes be seen phasing in and out of your world. These phantoms are other players as they simply play the game, and they're a nice reminder that others are doing just as you're doing. Summon signs can be placed down so that you can be summoned into another world to help another player. Up to 2 players can be summoned by the host at once, and once at least one has been summoned, your world can be open for invasion. An invasion is when a player uses an item to search for worlds to invade so they can kill the host. Red summon signs can be placed to to bring another player into your world so you can fight them. If you want a fair pvp experience, there are 3 colosseums throughout the land that have their own sets of rules to play by or choose from. Lastly, if you are invaded, you can use an item to call for help so you have an ally summoned to rid the invader.

No matter how you want to play this game, the right way is the way YOU choose.


[Design]

- How the design affects the gameplay -
Elden Ring has a massive amount design elements that merge amazingly with the gameplay. The developers of this game are known for environmental storytelling. By surveying your environment, you can get insight into the story of the game, or know if an area is dangerous. But many of the design elements of the game can influence a player's decisions. I suggest that you pay attention to your environment as you travel. :)

- Music and Ambiance -
If the visual elements don't make a good enough of an environment for you, I found the ambiance to be perfect for every area I visited. The songs are elaborate and beautiful, and fit each situation very well. I haven't had a single issue with audio choice.

- Story -
If you're a fan of lore, I have fantastic news for you. There are pieces of lore in just about every corner of the game. Weapon descriptions that give crucial detail on a specific character or location, the architecture implying the origins of a place, enemies being in specific places.


[My Thoughts]
- My Experience -
I have always been a fan of titles like The Elder Scrolls, Destiny 2, Call of Duty, Pokémon, Dark Souls and such; games that give you an abundance of choice so you can play however you wish. Elden Ring to me is the best game I have ever played. The care put into it is immense, and I consider it a masterpiece. I can see myself playing it for years to come, trying new things or reliving the experience. Subjectively, it's a 10 out of 10 for me, because the shortcomings pale in comparison to the strengths, and that's how I think. Objectively, there is no such thing as a perfect game. There will always be imperfections and issues a game will have, but I can see Elden Ring as being one of the top games of this decade.

- Is this game for you? -
Regardless of what games mean to you, I suggest that you try it out for yourself to see if it's for you or not. Generally, if you like open world, challenge, choice, multiplayer, and stunning graphics, I would say it's likely you'll enjoy Elden Ring. Issues that I saw from myself or other friends that played the game, it's a pretty demanding game when it comes to your PC specs. Often times a friend of mine would have FPS issues and needed to turn the graphics down a bunch, and it ended up looking pretty rough. Although lag is an issue in every pvp experience, it was especially frustrating to me in Elden Ring because much of the core gameplay revolves around timing your inputs, and any delay is a big difference.",2023-03-02 09:29:23,True,0,0,True,False,57,1,21925,199,21925,2023-03-02 03:15:16,1459,0.9967,positive,5 stars,0.5235832035541534

1382,133902722,"I always found the Souls games to be a bit inaccessible, but Elden Ring was the first time I really ""got"" what is special about the genre and about From Software. 

The unique world, with lore as deep as you care to delve, full of brilliant design and art direction, makes Elden Ring stand out as uniquely enticing among a sea of same-y open world games. There are no quest arrows or compasses, and minimal hand-holding in general; a refreshing harkening back to a time when RPGs didn't focus on being streamlined as much as they did on being immersive. Everything has an exciting air of mystery. You have to explore in Elden Ring, and it doesn't feel like a chore or a distraction or a time sink standing in the way of getting to the good stuff. None of the content here feels like filler. (The vast majority of it is optional, in fact. Side quests are not afterthoughts, they're the core of the experience.) Exploration is rewarding here. It's what you'll want to do as you play, and the game's design philosophy is all about encouraging it, letting the player mostly direct their own journey.

Combat can be difficult, yes, but also rewarding and deep, offering tons of build options where most things feel viable and nothing feels particularly obligatory. Most of what turned me off about the souls-like genre before, was not wanting to reach a sticking point and becoming frustrated with my inability to advance. Elden Ring is full of challenging bosses that you may bang your head against, but the open and non-linear nature of the game means you always have some other content you can go do instead if you get stuck on a particular encounter. Leveling up and finding better gear is basically always an option. Elden Ring challenges, and can sometimes frustrate, but never quite enough to keep you away. And the feeling of accomplishment when you are successful is all the sweeter.

It's clear when you play that for the game's creators, this was a labor of love. It's not perfect, but what flaws it has are easy to overlook in face of it's many virtues. If you're like me and you're apprehensive about it because of the Souls genre's reputation for difficulty and high skill floor, do yourself a favor and take the chance on this one. You may surprise yourself, and this game will probably surprise you.

I want to like this game. I really REALLY want to like this game. 
But I don't. 
Why?
Becuase the first 1/2-2/3 of this game is good! Very fun, lots of enemy variety and exploring every nook and cranny is a fun and rewarding experience! The bosses for the most part were a great time to smash my head against.
And then i got to the Atlus plains and the game became a boring irritating slog. Almost instantly too. The bosses become repeats of bosses you've already seen, the basic enemies are the exact same as the enemies that you've seen for the last 4 areas, just tankier and hit harder. The game feels like they front loaded it with all of the exciting content then desperately had to fill in the rest of the game with copy and pasted content. 
It managed to retroactively dislike previous boss fights by having the exact same boss show up again, and im not talking about some random enemy demon or tree, im talking about storied named bosses that you beat and then they just randomly show up again. There are roughly 10 bosses that you have to fight only once. Out of 170.
It is honestly one of the most frustrating games i've played in where the first 2/3 are really really fun and then you run into a steel wall of disappointment and frustration.
Honestly is worse than Dark souls 1 and 3.",2023-03-02 06:54:40,False,5,0,True,False,249,12,8805,2615,8805,2023-03-02 06:40:31,245,-0.782,negative,2 stars,0.4699324468771617

Its changed my view on how I like, view and experience video games. And i've been playing games since i was 5 (am now 1 month away from being 24). 
You know how people say ""oh it grew on me"" this does that but it doesn't stop growing on you. We're all curious naturally being human beings its in our DNA, our blood to explore and try. There's endless amounts of that in this game. The only thing that has more to offer, in that area of exploration and curiosity, is life itself. And as odd as that may sound for me to say talking about a video game. its true.

1454,133892273,"First souls game for me.  I hated it.  Put it down for several months.  Decided to try it again because a buddy of mine kept playing it.  But during those several months, I was grinding the crap out of monster hunter world which I believe helped me understand the mechanics of Elden Ring.  You're grinding a lot, you want to build your character as much as you can in order to die less and in order to defeat the boss.  A game that i once hated but now I love because you realize how flexible this game is.  You play the game how you want to play it; you set the difficulty how you want to set it.  There are so many ways to play the game and i believe that is how a game should be.  On top of that, a very beautiful game.  Give this game a shot, be patient with it and it will give you the tools you need (literally like spirits to help you tank for example) if you choose to use it to enjoy the game throughout.  It's no wonder it won game of the year.

1524,133880837,"""After about 50 hours in; I'm extremely disappointed. The obvious flaws of previous DS games is present once again (jank movement, enemies swinging through the same walls you bounce off of... the list goes on) but NOW there's even more jank! You have tedious ass platforming on a swivel stick goat, you have scaling bosses negating any sort of leaving, getting stronger, and coming back... you have no inspiration to explore because the boss you're stuck on will be just as (if not more) difficult when you return.

There are BROKEN npcs in this game. Example: There's a singing harpie in the lake that does piss all damage to you. You can sit still and solo him and the entirety of his guards.
Unless. Unless he uses one move that AUTOMATICALLY HITS (it actually puts your character into an animation at it's start that becomes uncontrollable) and one shots you.

A random, singing, low level harpie. Has piss all stats but contains a ONE HIT KILL.

And there are a LOT of these scenarios. Balancing doesn't exist in this game.

The movement issues and fighting problems could be EASILY identified by even 10 hours of play test from one human, so I'm beyond sure they're aware and just throw it into the ""Difficulty is fun regardless of design"" basket they love to bank on.

The game is a slap in the face. It takes away the core concepts of an ARPG, but keeps the difficulty of pretentious level movement.
And the pausing. Holy ever loving fuck, the ability for enemies to slow down one of their attacks at random in a string of nromally quick attacks. What the fuck? It's not something WE can do so why would you have to contest with it?

This game amounts to 100+ hours of jank deaths then RnG'ing through moves used into a victory that honestly... feels hollow as fuck by the end. I don't feel as if I mastered their moveset and could destroy them at any time now that I have; I just feel that one of their moves didn't AUTO KO me and I happened to pull a win. I don't feel like I put the work in to get stronger to surpass it, I feel as if it's the same fight as before I went and leveled. Once again negating my effort.

I'm sorry but. Not sorry. This game needs a massive overhaul to become enjoyable. Right now the only people sucking this game off are diehard souls fans who believe that FromSoftware can do no fucking wrong.

But. It can. And does. 1995 PS1 titles had better programmed clipping ffs."" - DragonfruitCapable

1532,133879927,"Coming from someone who's played through every Souls game multiple time, plus Bloodborne/Sekiro, with Bloodborne being my favourite, this game is such a let down! They've essentially taken Dark Souls 3 and slapped it into an open-world. 

My biggest gripe with the game is they've seemingly made the game hard just for the sake of being hard. It seems like most enemies, especially bosses, are all running at Bloodborne speed (with 360 gymnastics, jumping all over the place, infinite stamina, spamming combos, crazy damage) while the player character is running at Dark Souls 1 speed. Gone is the challenging yet fair game-play of their previous games.

My second gripe is the open-world aspect. It's so boring! There's not enough in it to actually explore, so you're essentially just running from one major area to another, with a few bits and pieces in between. The atmosphere and the look of the world is great though. 
Elden Ring would've benefited so much more from proper interconnected world design.

Nearly everything else is also just copy pasted from previous games, the combat, the animations etc.

Not to mention that my computer died after 20 hours of my first play through and all of my save data was lost. I had to completely start over and at this point the gameplay was more of a chore than anything else. I don't know if I will end up finishing the game because every enemy I fight drains more and more joy out of this game. I have no clue what is happening story wise by the way.

The combat is great, but could be better designed borrowing some elements from its predecessors (as sekiro, for exemple) there is such a thing as greatly designed difficulty and poorly designed difficulty. This game stands in the middle. In conclusion; the combat is good and memorable but with some issues that start to become too clear in NG+. The PvP is suffering from same balence issues in the current moment (patch 1.08 -one of the clear issues is the new patched light roll, its is such a safe mechanic that a stalemate can be forcefully dragged the end of the match by just dodging as stated by some experienced streamers)).

1583,133864626,"Despite the open-world singleplayer RPG genre continually devolving into pointless fetch quests, poorly written dialogue, and excessive hand-holding, Elden Ring stands out by doing everything exactly how other games don't - and it works beautifully.

This is essentially my first Souls game. I very briefly played DS3, and barely played Sekiro, so I began Elden Ring with an open mind and virtually no expectations. I assumed I'd be in for an interesting, combat centric pseudo-RPG that would be confusing and frustrating.

That's what I got, however for some reason, despite initial frustrations with difficulty, the overload of information that is the stats screen, and the complete lack of guidance in what to do, Elden Ring is absurdly captivating. The environments are varied and gorgeous, dungeons are clearly crafted with care and attention to detail, and characters are interesting (lovable sort ahead).

This is the first game that has had me absolutely and entirely immersed since some of my all-time favourite single-player experiences such as Fallout: New Vegas or Skyrim. The Lands Between is an expanse packed to the brim with fun content, interesting loot, and once you start exploring you never want to stop. The questlines are interesting (though you'll definitely need some help from Fextralife), and the boss fights are straight up epic. The music is downright beautiful and the visuals are so unique, so stylized, and so gorgeous in so many different ways.

I have tried to write and rewrite this review for months, and every time, I feel dissatisfied with my own ability to convey exactly how much this game has blown me away. But now, I think I've found the perfect way to put it:

I put down Elden Ring after playing non-stop, clocking almost 300 hours. Wanting to scratch my open world RPG itch, I revisited Witcher 3 and put in a cool 70 hours then put it down for a reason I couldn't understand. So I put together a new Skyrim modlist, spent probably 30 hours modding and troubleshooting and then another 30 playing, then put it down for a reason I couldn't understand. Hogwarts Legacy came out, and despite my love for the Harry Potter universe, for some reason I couldn't even push myself to finish the main story. I finally relented, and came to terms with the fact that I'd just rather be playing this game.

Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It is an undeniable champion amongst a stale genre saturated with mediocrity and tired franchises. It is a tour de force, a chef d'ouvre, a pièce de résistance. Yes, I pulled up a thesaurus.

1619,133854579,"NOTE: I played this game at launch.

It's okay.

This review will compare Elden Ring to Dark Souls III a lot for obvious reasons.

The open world formula hurts this game a lot. A sense of bewilderment is common when you move around with barely any direction at all. You get indications to sites of grace, but that's it. When i tried going someplace interesting on my own i got stomped instantly. If i didn't explore the crevices of the vast empty land, i was under leveled. If i explored everything then i saw the same ruins asset and enemies scattered everywhere. It felt like a grind and exploration for the sake of exploration.

When i moved on to the ""correct"" path, and there certainly is one, although the game nor the players tell you that, it all felt very good. The pacing was amazing. This harkens back to my previous statement; when the developer guides you in and puts you through the curated experience (i.e you play it like Dark Souls 3), it's really, really good. When you actually do open world content, it actually kind of sucks.

A huge flaw in design for me is the way they introduce you this danger. Spoilers: There is a point in the game where you get transported from the starting zone, to a much higher level Zone, Caelid. It's very obvious you are supposed to, and should, run. So i did. I got to a site of grace and went back home. This is introduced if you enter an obscure cave with a chest at the end. The run where i didn't do this, and entered as i normally would with Torrent, i got stomped by the enemies and lost my runes. 

Therefore, it's apparent to me that the game is made to be explored and scoured for treasure. However, this content is repetitive. The same reused caves and bosses are littered across the map and give you cool stuff. The enemies here are annoying and the same in all of them, with varying layouts. Completing these is mostly a chore you do to unlock things. Not once did i do a dungeon and find it a refreshing or interesting experience. Oh, and if you skip all these you will likely be under leveled and miss out on all the cool stuff.

Following the curated experience is good. I wish they had taken more steps to gently guide you in game instead so they could lean into what they do best, the ""dancing"" with the bosses. Dark Souls 3 had exquisite combat flow and each boss had a built-in rythm to learn, with few exceptions (looking at you, Oceiros). The satisfaction from completely dismantling a boss by learning their every move was amazing. It truly felt like you rose from the ashes and became stronger by learning every time. The bosses in Elden Ring attack you so mercilessly that you offload some hits to your summons instead or just abuse magic so you avoid the combat.  The openings you gain are therefore the boss attacking your meatshield instead of your own skill dodging their attacks and abusing these openings, especially if you use heavy weapons. 
I repeat, the intended way to play the game is by not interacting with the boss.

To see the anthisesis of this, and my ideal version of the game, look at the Iudex Gundyr or Dragonslayer Armor fight from Dark Souls 3. 
To summarize, I feel the design around summons and the bosses are poorly done. Removing summons in boss fights, if not altogether, would drastically improve the game. There is no option to not use summons unless you want to use exploits, metagame or otherwise play OP builds, and not what you find fun.

The weapons and ashes of war are good. The combat is better with more variation and more moves to learn. The progression is there.

TL;DR The game is okay, but ultimately dissapointing coming from Dark Souls 3. Two steps forward in some directions, two steps back in others.",2023-03-01 12:40:25,False,3,0,False,False,159,6,4302,0,4302,2022-04-06 23:47:30,677,0.9852,positive,3 stars,0.49998363107442856

1660,133844637,"I have to say, Elden Ring is easily one of the best games I've played in recent years. The world is absolutely stunning, and the level of detail that has gone into creating it is truly impressive. I found myself constantly getting lost in the game's vast open world, always discovering new areas and secrets.

The combat mechanics are also top-notch, as expected from a FromSoftware game. Every enemy encounter felt like a challenging and rewarding experience, and the boss battles were some of the most epic and intense I've ever played in a video game.

But what really sets Elden Ring apart is its storytelling. George R.R. Martin's involvement has clearly had a significant impact, as the game's world and lore are rich and deep, with plenty of twists and turns that kept me hooked throughout.

Overall, Elden Ring is a masterpiece of a game that truly deserves all the hype it has received. It's a must-play for any fan of action RPGs or FromSoftware's previous titles.

1749,133832428,"[h1]Pretty damn good. - 9.25/10[/h1]

Alright, just to start off, I truly believe this game is fantastic. But to truly appreciate it, you have to go in with the right mindset. Oftentimes it seems like people hop into this game to prove something to themselves or others and then have their fragile egos shattered when the game proves to be a bit of a challenge. This was sort of how I went into the game. A buddy of mine who was a bit of a Souls veteran decided to brag a bit about beating the Tree Sentinel (first field boss you come across) at base level (they chose Vagabond, I think). So I thought to myself, ""I'd like to do that too"". And if you've never played a Souls game (me), it's a bit of a humbling experience. However, your persistence WILL pay off. My first time beating the Tree Sentinel took probably more than 40 tries. My successful run was about 20 minutes long and I felt great since I beat him with a Level 1 Wretch. Now, I've learned to beat him in under 3 minutes. That's the thing, you just get better. When you can keep your appreciation for the game above your ego, you can have hours upon hours of fun while watching yourself become better at the game. I'm currently about to reach 500 hours as I'm typing this. Still having a blast with the whole thing. That being said, there are some definite pros and cons to the game which I'll list:



[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
-[b]Mouse and Keyboard controls.[/b] Honestly, I played through the entire game with mouse and keyboard. It wasn't horrible, but it was quite frustrating. From what I've heard, it's a constant FromSoftware issue. The games are supposedly just meant to be played on controller. I had a constant issue trying to do charged heavy attacks. Any time I'd hold down the heavy attack button, I would be locked into a light attack immediately after. I eventually managed to fix this by uncapping my frames with a mod, but we shouldn't have to risk getting banned to enjoy the game properly.

-[b]60 FPS cap.[/b] Last I checked, the game is still locked in 60 FPS. It plays very smoothly, but if you have anything over an RTX 3060, you probably want to see what Elden Ring can do. So I ended up playing the rest of the game at 170 FPS and 140% FOV using a mod. Was silky smooth after that.

-[b]Multiplayer limitations.[/b] So, if you're expecting to just hop into the game and play the whole thing with your friends, guess again. FromSoftware decided that you need to craft an item every time you want to play with a friend. On top of that, you lose access to your horse, summons, ability to traverse freely, sitting at graces, and from what I've seen, the ability to parry. It's just not a fun experience at all. However, there is a Co-op mod which fixes all of those things and is quite fun to play with. Invaders absolutely hate it, but nobody cares what they think anyway so mod it up. Just remember to disable EAC. v:

-[b]Awkward quest management.[/b] So, unless you're following along to an online guide, there's a pretty high possibility that you're going to progress passed a quest and potentially lock yourself out of content because of it. This then forces you to either make a new character, reload your save (assuming you're aware of how to do that), or go into New Game+. It makes for a unique first playthrough, but it is a tad annoying when you realize all the cool stuff you missed the first time around.

-[b][i]Some[/i] limited fashion options.[/b] Not really an issue, but you might struggle to find some decent armor combinations. I know I personally did, but I'm pretty picky.



[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
-[b]It's a complete game.[/b] You're not going to find any areas where it seemed that the devs were cutting corners. You could maybe make a point about some repeat bosses, but all in all, nothing seems unfinished. Some people had some glitchiness when the game first came out, but I didn't have a single issue aside from anything I've said above. Honestly, these last few years, we've sort of grown accustomed to the consistent theme of game developers who just want to release a product and fix it over the game's life cycle. ([i]*cough* Call of Duty *cough*[/i]) That's just not a problem here. FromSoftware had an idea and they saw it through to the very end.

-[b]Amazing design.[/b] It's not hard to get caught in awe while looking around in this game. It's insane to think that a group of people got together and made this. From the boss design to the environments to the animations to the UI elements, it's just beautiful. There are some funky looking things here and there, but you can look up the lore behind them and your appreciation for them increases tenfold.

-[b]Replayability.[/b] There are so many different builds you can run in this game. You wanna run a Bleed build? Level your Arcane and get a quick weapon like a twinblade or dual katanas. Want to just go around slicing things with a big sword? Well, there are plenty of big swords in this game. Two-handing a weapon goes a long way, applying a 50% increase to your Strength stat. Like magic? You can choose between Sorcery or Incantations, both with their own respective stats and equipment scaling. Or, if you're really hardcore, go around with a naked Level 1 Wretch and bonk things with your club. That'll teach Malenia.

-[b]Good confidence builder.[/b] A lot of people insist that this is one of the easiest Souls games. Whether that is true or not, the fact of the matter is, the game is difficult. If you can beat Malenia, that's something to be proud of. Most people uninstall at Margit. So beating this game is something you can consider an actual achievement. Not to say it's a rare occurrence, but it's a long shot from the straight forward goals of many other games.



[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

1760,133830629,"I've been an avid action rpg player since I was a kid, starting with Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast.  In 2022 and 2023 I played a lot of Splatoon 3, Monster Hunter Rise, and am more recently Playing Risk of Rain 2, Valheim, and Deep Rock Galactic.  All of these games I listed have superb combat and very fitting combat.  They feel good, they're fun, and I find all of these games to control in an enjoyable way.  By that, I mean that they have excellent gameplay.

Elden Ring's gameplay feel and loop are very poor.  The controls and gameplay itself have offered me the least fun that I have ever had in an action rpg game.  

Now, before you begin harassing me in claims that I just don't like ""difficult"" games, I found that Elden Ring is one of the least punishing action rpgs I have ever played.  If you are spending your runes, as you should, then death in this game is literally not a problem at all and there is no reason to fear dying.  So punishing is definitely not a term I would use. ""Difficult"" is somewhat of a subjective term, but what I am assuming players mean by ""difficult"" in this context is not ""difficult"", but actually tedious.

You really only have about 3 things that you might do:

One is to dodge, dodge, dodge, and of course to dodge again and again.  The main gameplay loop is to continually dodge poor optimized, in terms of time, attacks.  The key to not getting hit is to time your dodge, but if you play this game or watch gameplay, there are so many times when you expect to get hit but don't or expect not to get hit but do.  Ultimately, this leads to nothing more than spamming the dodge button like a madman as a go around to this issue.  And that ultimately leads to boring gameplay.  

The second thing you might do is attack.  Attacks are done on a controller using the R1 and R2 triggers.  The R2 trigger gives you a kind of charge attack or a slower but heavier hit.  However, as we talked about timing issues, R2 is just far too impractical to even bother using with a basic melee weapon.  It is better to get your poke in with an R1 then run, or rather, to continue your dodge-athon.  Which leads me into explaining why this is so terribly boring.  You are spending most time avoiding combat and being disengaged for one, but more importantly, there isn't a lot of action coming from the player, or combos, or effects that might compromise the opponent, or disable them, or lead to giving the player some kind of advantage due to their fight strategy and so forth.  The action part of the action combat is the player running and evading a barrage of attacks or projectiles from an enemy combatant.  Sure there are spells and you can summon pets or something to spice things up, but if you want to play, or rather, engage in combat, your access to participate in the process of action within this ACTION rpg are incredibly limited.

The third main thing that might comprise your gameplay is using items, which would be a bomb, or a heal potion, or mana potion, whatever you are carrying with you.  These potions are your main source of healing or mana rejuvenation and you will be using them a lot to continue your combat participation.  However, there is a very very big problem with this system.  You want to make sure that you have the item you may need to use on the fly as your selected item because you do not want to have to change active items during combat, as the joystick that controls your sprite is separate from the joystick to change items, which would be your d-pad.  Now, strategically this adds excitement into what would be otherwise very boring gameplay, due to the strategy of selecting items before engaging or running away so you can switch to your mana potion to continue casting spells, or whatever, but the real problem here is that you are literally taking control off of your character in order to access your items.  The switching of items requires a letting go of control of your character and creates a back and forth of engagement and disengagement.  Monster Hunter does this too with their item system, but in the case of Monster Hunter it has very little effect on your ability to continue engagement in the battle.  You can wire bug and dive back in.  In Elden Ring you dodge like a madman, get far far away, then switch items or heal or whatever, then dodge dodge your way back in.  It's simply tedious and boring and this is because your sprite completely lacks mobility.  And,  Monster Hunter does not make you feel like you are giving up control of your character to access items. 

In sum, there are better games out there.  The popularity of this game just goes to show that it is not quality that people desire but to be a part of the popular. 

The best I could give this game is a 7/10 and even that 7 seems overly generous.  The combat is boring, does not feel rewarding, makes you feel gimped and weak (not in a positive way), discourages engagement, and is severely lacking in complexity or technique.  Defeating an enemy gives you no satisfaction due to anything you have done and simply leaves you with an empty feeling of relief.  I would not recommend this game to anyone.

ELDEN RING is what I always hoped and dreamed modern gaming would become. I am a huge DARK SOULS franchise fan and I would also declare this one easily the objective best one yet through the sheer hours of content at your fingertips.

You are tarnished. A forgotten and unimportant soul who is maidenless. Luckily you meet Melina who is willing to guide you through your journey as your personal maiden / waifu. She gives you the reins to a spiritual beast named Torrent and your objective it to defeat the Shardbearers and ultimately become Elden Lord through one of the various ways of doing so.

ELDEN RING is insane because it's a 2022 released game that is superior to all of it's predecessors and does not feature any kind of cheapness or monetization whatsoever. It's really a breath of fresh air and every waking moment spent playing this game is true peak escapism and entertainment factor. Featuring beautiful visuals and a way larger than necessary / expected world to explore. I've always liked the SOULS franchises' NPCs but this game takes it a step further in elaborating and explaining each and every character not to mention how cool they look and how they all stand out from each other.

The bosses are the reason to play these games and whether FromSoftware realised that or just decided to go with an open world filled with seemingly endless bosses isn't actually important. The fact the player has a map, a steed, and fast travel from the get go between Sites of Grace make the quality of life so good for veterans of the series who just want to ride past everything, enjoy the scenery, and defeat some legendarily high quality bosses. Many people claim this is the easiest SOULS game but they are definitely wrong since there are some bosses in this game that are far more difficult than anything we've ever previously encountered; the hardest bosses from past games were Orphan of Kos & Darkeater Midir, and those two do not even compare to the likes of someone like Malenia, Blade of Miquella in this game who is borderline impossible to do solo no matter how good you are. The world and it's levels are obviously easier then past games and I prefer it this way actually; because it rewards thorough exploration and gives the player the ability to choose how much of a challenge they actually want since they can seek out more powerful weapons and Ashes if they want, and get early upgrade materials that will out-scale the majority of the game, or you can simply follow the linear path and go from story required boss to story required boss in a straight line without enhancing your character too much which will prove much more challenging.

ELDEN RING is a one of a kind game and shows us how far FromSoftware has come from the cash grabby low effort days of something like DARK SOULS II. There will be nothing like this ever again I assume and if you only play one video game for the rest of your life, choose this one.

The lore is great, but nothing less is to be expected from a FromSoftware game. The open vast world gives the players many different areas to explore with unique and fun level design.

1813,133824328,"[H1]So what's it about?[/H1]
You are are revived and you find yourself in the Lands Between. Embarking on an epic quest you will need to find and to do what it takes to become and Elden Lord. 

[H1]The good[/H1]
The visuals, sound and music are stunning. The world building is great: there are so many locations to explore, so many secrets to discover and the monster design never gets boring. And then when you have thought you saw everything you are thrown in another big adventure. There are optional areas in the game that you may just walk by because you don't realize they are there. There are bosses and mini-bosses that you will not see unless you look for them. It brings you back to how games used to be: explore and find new things without everything being served on a plate to you. Being able to complete the game and then realize the game wasn't serving you all the content but instead you need to discover it is great. 

The multiplayer portion is similar to Death Stranding where other players can leave you messages and you can see little blood spots where other players died. It's also cool to see the ghosts of others moving through the world and of course you can PvP if you want if you have the correct items. It's a good thing to fully integrate this in the game as prevent you from feeling lonely. There is some PVE and PVP and with the right items equipped you can select what you would like to do.

The items and equipment that you can find is absolutely amazing: even more when you realize that there are no DLCs, microtransactions or other schemes. You pay what you get and it works. I wish other games were still like that. 

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
The difficulty can be punishing at times - it's part of the charm of the game / series but you might get frustrated because you feel it's unfair. You will need to build your character and get to understand the game mechanics or the bosses will make quick work of you. Without the right tactics you will die a lot regardless whether you are a high level or not. It can be frustrating but all it means you are not good enough - level up, practise, get better and rethink your tactics :-).

You will need to use a gamepad to play this game. I cannot see how you can play this with mouse and keyboard. I used a Switch Pro Controller and that worked great. 

While not experiencing bugs or system issues I got several disconnects from the multiplayer part because of ""Inappropriate Activity Detected, Unable to Start in Online Mode"". I have no idea what happened here as I was just riding my horse at those times. Usually after 10 - 15 minutes I was able to logging back on.

There are many extended quests in the game. You will not realize this at first as there is no quest book, tracker or even on-screen notification. As you can kill NPCs you may lose their story lines without even realizing it. 

You will have to make choices but there is not really a good or bad one so it's much how you want to role play. Because of this system as you may like to explore a lot you will find that quests have moved on: NPCs moved to a different location than you expected or you just don't realize there was a quest at all. This can be a bit annoying at times especially when you have play sessions every few days. It's hard to get back on track without making lots of notes.

The marker system on the map only allows 100 bookmarks but there are so many more areas to explore. I wish the limit was raised as in the end I had to keep track of my progress in a notepad. Very much how I used to play old style games.

Why can't we turn off chromatic aberration? I know there is a mod but I didn't want to play my first play through using a mod.

Your character cannot swim or climb I loved that in Zelda Breath of the Wild or Assassin's Creed and I wish we could do it here as well.

There are many, many systems in the game that you find or miss. Basically, you can upgrade just about everything but you need to find the right location, NPC and items. The game will do little to hold your hand it's up to you to discover. 

[H1]Summary[/H1]
I enjoyed my journey through the Lands Between so far and I will definitely return. It was tough at times but it felt like a breath of fresh air. The visuals and audio are some of the best, I have ever seen. The world building is amazing and I enjoyed all the secrets that I found but also that I learned there is even more to find. Hopefully other developers will study what Elden Ring does well and learn from it as it sets a new milestone for open world gaming.",2023-02-28 22:16:44,True,0,0,False,False,387,61,7256,0,7256,2022-11-22 19:09:09,867,0.9971,positive,4 stars,0.48446963561905754

1815,133823994,"I want to love this game so bad. The exploration and world building is only next to a game like outer wilds. Just wandering around this world feels so great and fills me with so much wonder and it baffles me to think all this land with rich history was forged by a game studio. Coming over a hill to see more land after I though I'd reached the edge of the map and the excitement that I get filled with is literally incredible. But that excitement is immediately thwarted by a large sigh and disappointment when I see a boss that's going to be tedious and frustrating to fight. 
This is why I know I can't love this game because the bosses in the game are just not fun to fight and there's over 100 of them spread over every inch of this beautiful map. 

The bosses are just tedious and feel more like I'm supposed to put more hours into leveling up than practicing to beat them. A large majority of the bosses contain move-sets and combos that can last up to 20 seconds only leaving the player to get in a measly hit which does a sliver of damage. So the player has to hope that within this insane, unreadable dance of attacks they don't get hit lest they die and then barely make a dent in the boss's health...Then repeat over and over again and then you have a large majority of the boss fights in this game. This form of combat feels less like a duel between worthy adversaries and more a like a toddler against Mike Tyson. Its just so tedious and doesn't leave the player satisfied for beating a challenging foe but instead leaves them exhausted and glad they don't have to do that fight again. 

I do recommend this game though. Its like actually insane how fantastic this open world experience is. I just think its unfortunate its bogged down by the horrendous and tedious boss combat. I don't think Elden Ring is a masterpiece by any means but its definitely the best concept game I've ever played. If FromSoftware can make another game of this same scope and open world combined with lets say the combat of Sekiro, my god would that be the game of my dreams.

1837,133818727,"I thought ""time for suffering"" so I bought this, and then behold, strong foe! Then this really shady role-playing ""maiden"" comes along - conveniently right after this other fella called me maidenless - and she's like ""Erdtree, and then seek Elden Ring"". Okay, will do!

Next thing I know, I'm trying fingers and everything bloody else I can scavenge because imps keep stealing my runes. ""Try parrying"" you might be thinking, well I'm trying but the noob in me hasn't packed his things and moved out just yet. Nobody I'd met thus far felt it worthwhile to mention all the death ahead, and then death ahead, but death ahead it is. If death was a currency I'd be the Jeff Bezos of the Lands Between, I tell ya.
""Stay calm, seek strength"" I said to myself as I dragged my demolished ass through Brazil after some vapelord decided to play a hilarious prank gone wrong, and that was only the beginning!

Boy, is this an experience. Gorgeous view, dog, Bill Clinton, sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension... could this be the game of all time?

Main critiques I have with this game is, the odd difficulty spike towards the end of the game but even then the game is still beatable, and the amount of things that you can miss out on if you don't get it at certain stages of the game.

an example of this can be [spoiler]When the capital city of Leyndell is covered in ash all prior items inside are gone[/spoiler] so watch out for that

and the disappointing PVP in comparison to other games this company has made in the past, I miss covenants :'(

1932,133799653,"What an absolute masterpiece of a game. Definitely deserved GOTY.

I have never played souls-like game before and I was very skeptical. In the beginning you are thrown in a massive world with little to no guidance and everything is written inside description notes found deep in your inventory. I, ofcourse, didn't knew about it and was banging my head around to find any useful information if possible.

Getting killed many times by Agheel Lake Dragon and eventually entering the trap inside ruins behind it xDD (I am pretty sure everyone suffered from it). Game felt unforgiving right from the start.

But, this is where open-word and true freedom started showing it's charm. I could just smack some dude and see if I am remotely capable of defeating them or not. Roaming around and going to depths as well as far away corners started paying off little by little. Although I was very slow at levelling up in the beginning (level 44 after 45 hours) but atleast I could explore at my own pace.

Took little bit help from ""Elden Ring Discord Server"" (very nice people) and kept going ahead. Beautiful locations and nicely optimized game were added bonus.

After a while, story and progression started to make sense and I could piece together progress map to move ahead and this is where the game began to look much more enjoyable. It almost took me 55 hours to fall in love with Elden Ring and realise it's GOTY awards. Completed lots of side quests and defeated almost every boss except (2 evergoals and dragon placidusax). Some bosses felt punishing even after learning so much and they gave true satisfaction upon defeating them.

My Rating - 10/10 (even without sale)
Gametime - 100 hours (if a noob like me took 130 hours, I am pretty sure average player will take a lot less)

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Only complaints I would have is the horse combat and movement could use some work as well as some of the bosses having spammy combos that are hard to dodge unless you get lucky or dodge at the exact right frame. Looking at you Malenia and your water fowl dance. Overall the game is great tho. Difficult but not impossible. Probably one of the easiest games From Software has made if you take advantage of stuff like spirit summons. Still doesn't stop the feeling of accomplishment once you get past that one boss you've spent an hour trying to beat tho.

It's the dream. An open world Dark Souls game. What's not to love? Shame it lost game of the year to Bill Clinton. So many ways to play and it's fairly noob friendly while still chewing you up and spitting you out like a Souls game should. I can't beat bosses naked with a ham sandwitch like some people, but once you find a build and figure things out, it's godly. Iv'e got a Sephiroth rivers of blood thing going on for my main character and it's great.

If you love co-op and hate PVP like me, grab the Seamless co-op mod from Nexus Mods. It uses Steam servers and a .ini password instead of Fromsoft's servers, a separate executable and bypasses the need for Epic's performance sapping spyware known as EAC. Make sure you get your steed and your summon bell before starting because you may miss them during co-op, but it's 100% full time co-op without the usual Souls summoning signs and boss restrictions. It's glorious fun. Watching your friend get yeeted off a cliff by a pumpkin head never stops being funny.

2000,133782612,"Elden Ring won Game of the Year, makes sense, its a great game.

Souls-Borne games usually aren't accessible to newer players, but this one certainly was. Over 120+ hours in, and I'm still being amazed by this. Don't think it might be too late to play this game, cause FromSoft still hasn't released a DLC. But with everything good, there is always bad.....


Jesus, From really needs to stop making random ""poison"" lakes, or in this one, the forsaken Lake of Rot. Go get Flame Cleanse me, and honestly to be true, it wouldn't be a souls game without one bad area. Actually that's not the only Hell you are going to go through. It's nice that they outsourced to religious figures, because the Subterranean-Shunning Grounds were made by Satan. Now I see myself as a idiot, but when we got to the very funny troll parkour that would lead to the Three Fingers, it made me so happy. I was constantly trying to not hurl myself off the Golden Gate Bridge, and honestly please FromSoft, it was very funny in the end when I figured out that I just had to ""Git Gud"" like everyone else was telling me. But one more hell....... MALENIA!!!!! I'm gonna say the truth, many guides online told me stuff, but ultimately, just why. It's a GOD-DAMN SEKIRO BOSS??? Man this is one middle-finger to every From enjoyer, because along with no Bloodborne PC Port after 7 F****** Years, we also get given a boss from Sekiro, which didn't get a DLC.

Lore is always an iffy subject in From-Soft games, because we have Youtubers that finish the job George R. R. Martin couldn't. The Only Thing I Know For Real though is that we should not have to figure out this sh** ourselves, and ultimately, my head hurts after trying to figure out why the worst bosses (Foreskin Duo) is repeated at least 3 times (separately or not). I get it, its a large game, you are gonna have to re-use bosses, but please. Godefroy (Godrick reskin) Two Godfrey and Loretta boss battles, and the same for Mohg and Margit (Not counting Morgott). At least Placidusax was cool. Would cry myself to sleep again over trying to figure out why I still suck at the game. 

Even after all the hatred written in this message for some parts, 10/10 game, would uninstall and go pull maidens IRL if I could, unfortunately this game probably stole all my rizz. Anyway please, anyone else wants a Bloodborne PC port? From please, I'm on my knees, begging, just give us the port........ maybe within this century???

2025,133778123,"I only recommend this game for it's adventure; exploration and beauty is unparalleled and cannot match any other soulslike. 

However, it's combat is simultaneously a repeat of old soulslikes but done in the worst way possible. The beauty of the soulslike combat system was one-on-one combat: attack, dodge, and parry. Keeping perfect time and rhythm. This game doesn't have rhythm or timing. Just constant barrages of attacks from every single enemy barring the largest and most awkward. You will feel under pressure every second but never a chance to retaliate except for only in the most minute openings. 

From Software's games have certainly felt the pressure of being ""Difficult"" and are being pressed to take it's formula and press it to it's logical maxima until it no longer resembles the original. These enemies and bosses do not feel like they are from the original or from any soulslike that has come out since, but enemies from non soulslike games. Games where the player should be able to return with equal force, but never can because they feel like they themselves are ripped from DS1.

This game will never reach the infamy of DS2 but so many encounters encompass what made that game more frustrating than fun: ambushes and memorization. Great hard games test reaction times not memorization, like the difference between the first and second Halo Legendary campaigns: where the second involved little reaction and plenty of memory after first failing many many times, the first always presented you with tests of skill for things you've previously gone through, clearly presenting the danger up front and allowing thought for your next moves for every encounter. The first Halo respected the player and wanted them to win, it understood it was a game and while it challenged the player it did not provide a wall that required narrow windows and laugh at you for not finding them. Elden Ring feels like the Dungeon Master that hated their players, the teacher that wanted you to fail, or the backstabbing friend that never was on your side.

If this was not a game then I would recommend it beyond exploring, if learning software engineering was a game I wouldn't recommend it, if learning art was a game I wouldn't recommend it, if being alive was a game I wouldn't recommend it. It doesn't matter how hard the anything is, you will eventually get good enough at to beat it. When people complain about souls games, they're not having fun. Its not because it's hard.

TL;DR/Bottom Line: The game is only kind of fun, but if every hobby, and almost every other game bores you, then you may find this game thoroughly fun after the exploration runs out.",2023-02-28 03:57:17,True,0,0,True,False,410,40,1189,1189,1132,2023-02-28 23:17:48,454,0.7279,positive,2 stars,0.42284242808818817

game absolutely tanks towards the end and is very front heavy, absolute masterpiece early to midgame. by the time you get to endgame there are very few new bosses (majority either reskins of earlier ones or 2 earlier ones combined into a duo that dont mesh together at all, the game gets a lot more linear with less interesting places to just come across and the balancing even at the recommended level is just not good.

the leveling system is terrible. find a new area? too bad because all of the enemies are 50 levels above you. sort of defeats the whole point of exploration no? once you remember that place and choose to go back youre extremely overleveled and kill everything in 1-2 hits including bosses. 

very overrated

Story is good and the fact that you're being called ''maidenless'' at the beginning is funny. The only down side of the game unfortunately is the coop. It's pretty horrible because if you plan to play it with your mates, it's pretty hard. While I was doing a boss (The rider near the church at the beginning), I was almost killing the boss and dodged him extremely well and played good, however me and my mate got invaded by some high level player and pretty much healed the boss with half hp). Yes you heard it right, not only the invaders are not being targeted by the mobs, but they can also use the bosses to easily kill you. For a new player that's pretty discouraging for them to even make em try to touch coop, considering that's the best part about a multiplayer, especially a souls game. If you plan on playing this on coop, I'd suggest another game like Nioh 1 or 2. It's a souls game and it may not be the same style as this one but it has amazing coop and I highly recommend that one too. I was going to give Elden Ring a 10/10 but due to this coop problem which is honestly pretty unfortunate, I give it an 8/10.

Even Malenia which people claim is harder than bosses like Nameless king, Artorius, Midir ect isn’t as tough as people make it out to be. Also as you mentioned in the video the reused bosses, assets, and so movesets bothers me too. The open world really feels pointless and bland like in Ubisoft games. Souls like games works best as linear dungeon crawlers like the dark souls games. Or semi open world like sekiro. During my first run I did an all bosses playthrough I just keep stopping to play other things since I found the bosses in this game so boring and easy compared to the other souls games. But 1 thing for sure is whenever I play the game again, I CANNOT bring myself to do any of the optional bosses again whereas in every other souls like game fromsoft made I do every bit of content available.

While there is nothing wrong with that and said games can provide entertainment, the overall experience tends to be forgettable. 

Elden Ring takes the established Souls formula and puts it in a Zelda like open world. After 500+ hours I still find new stuff, uncover dialogue with NPCs, etc. While all the elements to keep you entertained for hours upon hours are there, there is also a lot more. It's like a digital painting, a work of art. From the colour palette to the music. Even though the world is a bleak, surreal and dreamy nothing feels out of place. Every item, NPC, piece of dialogue feels like it belongs there for a reason. This unfortunately isn't always true for the side content, which is one of drawbacks of an open world.

The obvious shortcomings of an open world game are easily overlooked by the overall experience that is present here. It makes the Souls formula accessible to a larger mainstream audience without handicapping the experience or the artistic narrative.

Initially when I started playing, seeing the map, I thought how can the world be so small. Little did I know that it was just a small part of the entire world. As I progressed through the game, I realized each area is distinct and very well made. The eerie feeling in dark dungeons and thinking that a strong enemy may sprung out of the dark any moment keeps you on your toes all the time. There are a lot of variations in enemies and the boss designs are of different level entirely. 

I find most games that have a playtime of 10-20 hours are very detailed. But creating such a huge world and taking into account each and every detail is very impressive. Never did I encounter any bug as well. This game is well worth the money spent and even more.

Overall, it's a Soulsborne game, so I like it. However there are enough issues with it that any of the other Soulsborne games are just more fun.

undodgable attacks, hit boxes worse than DS1 (by some miraculous feat), being able to get hit by basic attacks while you're lying on the ground unable to move, and Fromsoft nerfing mimics to the point of them being basically useless are the main issues.

2212,133720904,"Good god this game is a masterpiece. I have played it pretty much nonstop since I got it almost every free moment I have (I am writing this as I play). The only reason I wouldnt recommend it is its addicting. This is my first souls game and very rarely do I have issues with it. 
Pros:
Hours of side content
Rich environmental and lore storytelling
Interesting characters
Open world and a non-linear experience letting you go at your own pace
Bosses are usually pretty fun and unique, even ones that reoccur as normal enemies later as it is incredibly satisfying to fight something as a boss and come back and beat it to a pulp as a regular enemy
Bosses are rarely unfair and it usually feels like your fault for dying either by being under leveled or unskilled
Speaking of being underlevel, leveling and power leveling to make fights easier is completely viable and legitimate way to play
Tons of secrets to explore and find granting new rewards
Cons:
Its a souls game, if you rage easy its not for you
Early game is brutal and hard and basically requires some grind or incredible skill
Camera can be buggy getting stuck and spinning with lock on
Lock on can fuck you as often as it helps you by randomly switching targets or body parts from slight mouse movements making you miss or get stuck
Horse combat can trivialize fights
Attacking with colossal weapons is sluggish but also seems to eat inputs meaning mashing can make you commit to extra attacks and take damage
When a something DOES feel unfair it feels EXTREMELY UNFAIR. (For me it was putting a magma wyrm in a tiny arena where it can basically take up the entire stage with one move it likes to spam that leaves lingering magma)
Some puzzles are insanely complex, almost requiring a video making blind playthroughs hard
Jumping and falling on someone COUNTS AS AN ATTACK and will make them hostile or OUTRIGHT KILL some characters, which can lock you out of some quests and even endings, This can be fixed with a specific item at a specific place but the location is never revealed or explained until you randomly find it.
Scaling feels wonky, and some enemies will seem overly tanky despite being much weaker previously, or youll come back after a few levels and theyll be a joke

Sorry those that love this genre, but this is just lame.  
I've been playing games for over 40 years, and this game reminds me of those crappy early games that were simple memorize the combo games, that threw in randomness to just make them unfair.    I've beaten many games on hard/insane level but this one takes the biscuit.
The only Souls-like game that actually has combat where you can plot your way through a mixed group of bad guys is Jedi Fallen order.   
For all those who will call me a troll, answer this question.   Did you get through this game without dying 500+ times???   If not, then this game is pure luck.....The only people that can claim to be ""gud"" at this game are those that went all the way through without dying once.    The rest just spammed your way through.
The only thing that would make this game bearable is to be able to save it when I want to, like just before the locked door you know insta-death is waiting behind.........but Nooooooo, I have to die coz my perfectly timed counter just missed and I'm dead, so I have to wait 15 seconds for the reload then battle my way through the same axe fodder for 10 mins, to get back to the ""boss"" to then watch and learn their moves, oops, lag, missed roll or missed counter......dead......rinse repeat.   jeez.

Re-skinned enemies from previous games. 
Same old gameplay, gets a bit stale, same shit different type of corn inside.

Personally for me the open world aspect only served to make the game more tedious than souls games usually are, I ended up getting ""souls fatigue"" about a quarter into the game, as the start of it is honestly quite dull overall.

2331,133692640,"Incredible game. FromSoftware knows how to make a game. This is my second Souls game and I put it personally below Dark Souls: REMASTERED. I think FromSoftware did an admirable job making an expansive open world, but personally found it to fall into the same pitfalls as any other open world game: repetition, boring caves, etc. I think it is better done than most, but it would have been a much better experience if it was more like Bloodborne or Dark Souls. 

My personal gripe is that despite the game rendering 21:9, it puts vertical black bars over the sides to force it to 16:9. I would beg FromSoftware to fix this. There is no reason to do this when the game obviously supports it. I have loaded into the game several times and not have the black bars on the screen and it is everything I wanted.

There aren't many builds in this game that I haven't done by this point, but a cavalry build is one I haven't tried. It's tough to do, since the horse cannot go into dungeons, but it's something I still want to try.

GET SEAMLESS CO-OP IN NEXUS if you play with a friend. It will make your entire game play experience 10 times better because you don't have to deal with the whole crafting the item to summon your friend, summon your friend, wreck the boss or die, wash rinse repeat countless times.

As an avid Bloodborne lover, good combat flow, and combat enjoyability is a must for me. One of the problems with most souls/soulslike games for me is when I beat a boss, I often feel a “ugh thank god that’s over with” feeling. I don’t get that victorious hell-yeah moment, I’m just glad it’s done and lowkey dreading the next boss that I come across. Elden Ring? Every boss fight is hard fought, but incredibly satisfying. The elation of taking down these gorgeously designed bosses is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before with any video game. It feels good to win. So good that I find myself constantly coming back to try new builds and new ways to challenge myself. 

If you’re new to the souls genre, I almost want to recommend waiting to play this game till after you try something like Dark Souls.

2445,133645240,"Note: This is not strictly a negative review, but the game’s overall design makes it hard for me to openly recommend it.

Elden Ring is an open world combat RPG, where battling with enemies is the center of everything. There is a huge world to explore where you find various items, that help your character you make in the beginning to become stronger statistically, but everything you find centers on your combat capability of course, since this is not an adventure game. Albeit this approach, the game offers some impressive vistas throughout the world you explore, somewhat curious NPCs that talk to you and most importantly challenges in the form of varying enemies and boss battles. There are many places you can visit, also underground, which all help you, at the end of the day, to become stronger by giving you more runes, that are basically a currency you buy levels with at checkpoints.
 If one is familiar with the developer’s, From Software, former titles, the risk reward mechanic is the same in here and the actual fighting mechanics are also the same as in Dark Souls games; you lose your runes when you die, but can retrieve them from your death spot, but lose them completely if you die again before that, and the fighting is basically careful observing of enemies while dodging (by rolling endlessly) and blocking.

The game is fun at the beginning, offering decent challenge, and at any point if you find the game too tough, which is likely, you can gain more levels by collecting runes for slaying enemies or simply exploring easier approachable areas. Since the game is very long in length due to the sheer size of the world, most players might wish to follow the main path straight to the end without much additional exploration, but alas, the game’s difficulty, even despite the help of a selectable phantom fighter (spirit ashes) who you can call in for help in tough spots, forces exploration to gain runes for the vast majority of players to overcome later tough enemies. This might not sound like an issue, since this applies to some other open world titles too, but the time it takes to explore to be strong enough is in tens of hours – I’m not exaggerating.
 While the beginning is fun and quite exciting, the more you play the more repetition kicks in, even if the areas around the map are visually different, but enemies repeat and so do bosses; they use the same models. Even the overall quality of level design is better at the beginning, the Stormveil Castle being at least to me the most exciting place to see and explore, after that perhaps a few notable places existing in the game. This castle is at the very beginning and after that the quality slowly drops the further you get, endgame being very tough and a slog to get through, mostly due to some nasty bosses.

The bosses are a big part of the studio’s focus and they are admittedly often fun to fight, but in this game most bosses are annoyingly designed, scaling in damage too much from the very beginning till the end. This vast damage they tend to inflict in a single strike makes the game more a hectic rhythm based act to avoid the worst hits, while waiting patiently for an opening to strike pretty much freely when the enemy takes it’s pause. I find this limiting character building wise, since I’m sure the game is extremely hard without putting many skill points on vitality (max health) to sustain more damage.
 The bosses also have cheap moves and combos, which often rightfully makes you feel like you die an unexpected and unfair death, but this is thankfully mitigated by the phantom helper that can take hits from enemies instead of you and even slightly damage them, so you can heal up on the side, perhaps cast a spell or incantation and prepare to strike again. So even if boss design is most often not as great as in previous games from the studio, especially compared to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, occasionally being even bad, the phantom helper is there for you making some bosses actually pretty trivial, which is not a bad thing if you don’t wish to be stuck on them in this - in my honest opinion - too long game.

I personally have explored almost everything in the world and I’m likely ”over leveled”, which would mean that in the main progression path I’m fighting enemies on a higher level than players usually are, but still, after playing so long, easily over 100 hours in fact, I’m still currently momentarily stuck at one mandatory very late game boss that, once again, has upped damage so that it can kill you in a short sweep of attacks. This fact is saddening to me, since the game has pretty fun exploration, the best yet character building in the studio’s history, amusing places to discover, and of course the action is intuitive and most often entertaining, but yet the game is enough of a slog to get through at many points and too repetitive. If you decide or rather need to explore much because of the difficulty that can spike, the game starts undoubtedly to feel overall as following: cheap. It is a cheap game in the end with talent and quality at many places, but filler content and bad design all over the place. This game should have been shorter in my opinion, or at least easy enough to complete quicker going straight through the main path, but for me - and I’m not a noob mind you since I have completed Dark Souls 1 and 3 and Sekiro, Elden Ring is simply too tough to my taste to call it enjoyable.
 As a side note, I might find the game so hard due to a faith build, meaning I use incantations in the game that are slow to cast in the heat of a battle, but this fact just tarnishes the game even more, because it truly doesn’t allow too much freedom in building the character if you want to excel as care free as possible - which you want, trust me.

Now you might find this game fun and most players looking for combatting challenge will do at the beginning for a long while, but I label this review as negative due to the overall quality throughout the experience and the too cheap and frustrating challenge you will face eventually, no matter how good you are. If you are good, you will overcome the challenge, perhaps even quickly, but I doubt many of the fights are that fun in any case, unlike in Dark Souls 3 for example, where the game is thoroughly quite carefully designed, albeit unforgiving.
 Consider this game if you are ready to face this disappointment I’m feeling here and in the case you are a fan of the studio’s previous work, but for many, you should think twice, remembering that this game is far from GOTY material like some might claim, because the quality is so varying. I think sound design and graphics should be better as well to call this a GOTY, since the tech is like a mix of last-gen and current-gen, leaning more on the last-gen.

Lastly about the mentioned technical side: The game runs decent enough if you have strong single core CPU performance and my RX 5700 XT plays it almost always at 60 FPS on max settings at 1440p, which the game is unfortunately capped at, but this hasn’t bothered me mentionably. There are areas that are bound to drop the framerate below 60 FPS, somewhere around 40 – 45, which is a slight annoyance, but those moments are rare. The game’s current version 1.08.1 is bug free, though it’s worth to mention that I experienced one freeze-up.

I told myself i would break a law every time i died. well this game is harder than i thought it was going to be. at first breaking the laws started out easy. I did to the first boss, The Fell Omen, almost immediately so i had to break the law. I went outside and J walked, no problem. Then i died to the golden horse guy and had to break another law, i ended up holding up a 7/11 for 87 bucks. I got home and hopped back on to try again. I died almost immediately again to that horse guy and went out to break another law.

But I have one objection to make...only one. Leonine Misbegotten. That piece of shit. That son of a bitch. That fucking pain in the ass of a boss. Don't get me wrong he is well designed and all, but I don't think I have ever hated a boss more than that ginger lion lookin' trash. All I hope for him is to choke on a huge bag of dicks daily from dawn to midnight. I fought Malenia and defeated her in 2 tries. I killed Placidusax first try. Rykard? Fucking owned his ass in the first phase and I even forgot to have the big sword equipped. And then the second try I didn't even bother to dodge. DEAD. But that asshole, he is something else. It took me about 6 to 7 hours to kill him. And once I did I was thrilled. I was over the fucking Moon. Now please imagine my surprise when I FOUND HIM AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE RADHAN, AND HE HAD COMPANY A FUCKING ANNOYING BITCH ASS KNIGHT. SO IT WASN'T ENOUGH THAT I CANNOT KILL THE LEONIN BITCH BY HIMSELF BECAUSE MY BRAIN CANNOT COMPREHEND HIS MOVE SET, HE HAD AN ANNOYING IDIOT KNIGHT WITH A BIG SWORD AND A POINTY SHIELD TO STICK IT UP MY ASS. AND THE I FOUND HIM AGAIN IN LEYNDELL 2 TIMES. AND THEN AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE LORETTA AT ELPHAEL.

Where this game shines is the satisfaction in FINALLY whooping the boss' ASS and getting that sweet new equipment to beat the next one, no matter how many times they knocked me down.

It essentially is many tiny little dark souls tunnels on a gigantic map without any kind of coherence or connection between them. Its as if they just took all the crap levels they had left over from the previous dark souls games and smushed them together into one game using the ""open world"" excuse to not have to build any kind of atmosphere or continuity between the levels.

Enemies repeat constantly. You get to see the same copy paste enemies all over the map which would work if this was dark souls tunnels but not with these large ""open world"" levels.

It feels like a cheap korean mmorpg open world with dark souls ""dungeons"" which you go into and get absolutely nothing at the end of the tunnel because the tunnel does not interconnect with anything else.

This game is amazing and disappointing at the same time, I feel like a lot of these problems is the symptom of being a open world game. 

The dungeon design is incredibly frustrating with the way forward being chosen at random it seems, I think this was done to encourage exploration but it just leads to multiple times you run loops around a dungeon while getting very confused. 

The bosses are doable at lower levels but incredibly tedious to fight since they take ages to kill. This is the result of them being given a very generous amount of health and one mistake can lead to you getting one shotted. But also this works in the other way where bosses you missed feel way too easy and die in seconds.

Despite all the mistakes, and trust me this game has mistakes, I love it! But it sure has areas to improve in.

2615,133605015,"This game absolutely is massive, with an absolutely colossal map and another huge map underneath, there's tons of stuff to do. There are piles of awesome spells and super fun upgradeable weapons, crazy bosses and wicked powers. There's a lot of flexibility to experiment with different builds because you can re-spec like 9 times per playthrough if you want to change up your playstyle.

 It seems to have a really nice community, in game and online that enjoys helping each other out and sometimes invading others to role play the bad guy and try to stop the hero! Awesome fun!
 
The game is beautiful and hopeful but also filled with despair, from a lore standpoint. This game is definitely challenging but there are many resources online to help the player though tough parts or community members or NPC spirits that can be summoned to assist in clearing hard bosses or areas.

The cut scenes and some of the areas you find in this game are so badass and gnarly. Very metal, which i love personally.

Now for the bad because honesty is key, there are times that you have to jump from object to object and its easy to die doing that. These parts of the game aren't generally necessary to go to thankfully, but can have really good rewards at the end, so there's incentive.  

The game punishes mistakes and that can be frustrating.

I bought it slightly on sale, which is great, but any dark souls fans will get their monies' worth out of it.

2658,133590357,"Elden Ring is an action role playing RPG game/PP crusher simulator created by FromSoftware where you explore the open world of the Lands Between and fight hard bosses in between completing quests and trying not to die. I fell in love with the Soulsborne series when I first started playing Bloodborne on the PS4, after which I went out on a whim and bought myself Demon's Souls for PS3 as well as Dark Souls 1-3. I heard about this game a while ago, got hyped and pre-ordered as soon as I could before waiting a year to start the game. Having platinumed the game on PS5 and hoping to start on Steam someday in the future, here are my thoughts:

The Story is one of those things that you just have to kind of explore and figure out by piecing together pieces of dialogue, item descriptions as well as environmental cues. I can't even tell you much of anything about it, but what I can say is like all FromSoft Souls titles, I love it. It keeps the goal simple: You're a Tarnished (an individual who was banned by the former queen from the Lands Between) who is going for the spot of Elden Lord and to do so has to fight through several different demigods in order to do so. You'll run into several characters via out in the world or the Hubworld, Roundtable Hold, who could do anything from basically nothing to giving you entire new endings. That's all I have to say for the plot:

The Gameplay is basically almost the same as the other games in the Souls Series. You go from area to area to loot objects, fight bosses, complete particular quest lines for certain rewards, invade/fight enemy invaders except one caveat: It’s open world. And I mean it’s OPEN world. The other games were a lot more simplified as well as complex: they were a bit open in terms of pathways, shortcuts etc but they also had a straight way from point A to point B as well. In this game, everything is basically tenfold in terms of it’s game play design from how you get to certain areas to how to fight certain bosses. One example: [Spoiler] In order to get to Leyendell there’s a couple different ways you can get to that region. One is you could ride up the Grand Lift of Dectus, where you need two halves of a medallion in which you can get each at Forth Haight and Fort Faroth. Another way you could do it is by going underneath a church near the Lift, going through a village and climbing up a mountain before killing the Magma Wyrm and getting up that way. ANOTHER way is to get killed/abducted at the bottom of the waterwheel in Raya Lucaria where you wake up in an area at Volcano Manor and fight your way out of the caves.[/Spoiler] Stuff like this is mindblowing and is amazing how much attention to detail and scope it took to truly create such a thing. And keep in mind this is only one example, I can’t list everything because truthfully, like this game, there’s so much stuff TO list that I’d be making a f u c king video essay on it. But also in essence I do think that can be to this game’s detriment as well: It’s so huge that it’s kind of overwhelming with its scale, and with that it can lose some of it’s uniqueness when you see multiple of the same bosses repeated over and over again with different skins. I also found the combat to be hard definitely, challenging is a yes, but I’m not sure if it’s just because I suck but I felt that now in this game it’s definitely more geared towards having summon spirits for boss combat? I’ve always been someone who liked to coop anyways so I’ve been cool with it but it can be kind of frustrating at times with certain bosses. I guess to finish this off just be aware that this game is difficult yes, but the community is great. Sure, are there a s sholes who will just tell you to “Get Gud'' and make believe they aren’t a bunch of basement dwelling pee larpers? Yes. But the amount of people who will go out of their way to help you for no reason other than why not is amazing. Just know in order to summon people: Get the Furlcalling Finger Remedy. They can be found as loot, crafted via Erdleaf Flowers, bought from certain merchants, etc. Also for certain places to be able to summon other players you have to activate summoning pools so keep a lookout for small statues.

Sound Design/Art/Graphics; all of this is great and I’m not even sure I could expand upon it other than I don’t feel that the Soundtrack is as memorable as the other souls games? Either way it didn’t matter to me as it fit in the background and made everything memorable as I played even though when I got out of it I didn’t remember much. Still it looks great, the art design is amazing and graphics are good too.

I can’t do justice to this game in a single Steam review, but if you’re new to the series or you wanna try it out just know this: Play fresh, wing it a bit and have fun, try not to get overwhelmed and experience EVERYTHING because it’s impossible (though it is possible to get all the trophies in one playthrough if that’s your thing). Research the game a bit, see what builds you want to go for (though your starting class does kind of gear you in certain ways so I’d say research BEFORE you start the game unless you just kinda want to wing it), farm a bit and upgrade your stats. But please god take breaks and take it at your own pace; because you will die and die and die some more and then die again; it can be a frustrating and strange loop but when it clicks with you it clicks with you. And if it doesn’t? That’s ok too and there’s no shame in it. Elden Ring is the culmination of all the things that FromSoft has done with the other Souls games and expanded upon it with great effect (and sometimes mixed results in certain things), but to me it certainly deserves the Game of the Year title.",2023-02-25 17:02:55,True,6,0,False,False,524,58,15,15,14,2023-02-25 17:18:26,1086,0.9992,positive,4 stars,0.4915713046987851

2685,133581748,"The perfect game for those who like to spend their evenings getting repeatedly pummeled into submission. If you're into BDSM, then this game will have you moaning.

From the very beginning, Elden Ring will whip you into shape, throwing you into a world full of sadistiic enemies and punishing gameplay. Every corner you turn is like a new level of torture, a new level of submission to your gaming overlords.

But don't worry because the pain is worth it. There's nothing more satisfying than finally defeating that boss that's been spanking you for hours. And when you do, you'll feel likea real badass!

Elden Ring is also full of surprises, just like a good dominatrix. You never know what's coming next, and every new challenge is like a new way to be punished.

The graphics are gorgeous, and the soundtrack will have you begging for more. But let's be honest, you're not here for the aesthetics. You're here to be put in your place, to be dominated by a game that knows no mercy.

It's no wonder that Elden Ring has been hailed as the game of the year. It's a true work of sadomasochistic art. The unforgiving difficulty, the punishing combat, the unpredictable challenges - it all comes together in a way that's truly amazing.

Sure, you'll rage and scream and maybe even throw your controller across the room a few times. But in the end, you'll be left with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that few other games can provide.

2693,133579286,"Eighty-ish hours and one trophy later, five takeaways from The Lands Between™:

* The game's hardware requirements are correct: if you want to play Elden Ring at a consistent 1080p60, your CPU needs at least 6 cores and 12 threads. Never mind the main storyline, the true final boss is realizing that lowering the display resolution and graphics quality to 720p/Low won't get you a stable 60fps on an otherwise-serviceable quad-core CPU. If you don't have a hexacore CPU, see if your graphics software can lock the frame rate to 30; I found a steady 30fps to be a better visual experience than a stuttery ~45fps.
* After a single, pseudo-100% clear spanning several weeks, speedrunning this twice for the other ending achievements was a breath of fresh air. 
* Vigor and armor can prevent being one-shot in combat, but nothing can prevent getting one-shot by fall damage. This rule applies to your enemies, too.
* In a world where 'RTFM' is sage advice, if a game isn't going to explicitly tell you what's going on, never be ashamed to do your own research. It's always easier to search for information out-of-game than to search for your lost runes in-game.
* Whoever made the final call on the HUD only displaying piecewise elements that were recently used without flickering or cluttering up the screen deserves high praise. Conversely, whoever made the final call on putting a boss directly in a pile of scarlet rot *more than once* needs to update their resume.
* Bonus 6th takeaway: Malenia's a bully, but Waterfowl Dance is the only truly threatening aspect of her kit. Try complaining less and getting better at the game. Or you can equip Blasphemous Blade/Magma Wyrm Scalesword and press L2 after dodging, that works too.",2023-02-25 14:32:38,True,1,0,False,False,462,2,4780,698,4780,2023-02-25 14:03:41,296,0.7497,positive,4 stars,0.3857935518026352

2715,133570782,"Ignore the hype, ignore you're friends, don't bother playing this game. REQUIRES AT LEAST 10 hours of tutorial videos on builds, basic game mechanics, and side quests that exist in the game before actually playing. The game does not teach you anything about how to play it, you need to rely on outside help in order to progress. This includes basic things like how to navigate the menu, how to create a strong character, which weapons to use, etc. The difficulty curve is set up so that you NEED to learn these things early on, else you will not progress in the game.

To start off, here is the entire plot to the game: you want to be elden lord, maybe. That's it. Some characters are more or less keen on that, but it's not really clear. Most of the lore and ""story"" of the game can be found in item descriptions, and its the most ineffectual way to tell a story that I have ever encountered. Side missions have zero logic to them, basically you need to talk to every NPC in the game in order to progress a mission without referencing a guide or tutorial. Most missions have a point where you grab some item like ""the sacred toenail of Ira the dancer"" and for some reason you are supposed to know that ""Ephesius"" needs that to make it to Narnia or some nonsense like that. Many of these side missions are necessary to beat the game at a reasonable difficulty level, else you will be under leveled or poorly equipped to face required bosses.

Honestly I can't talk about this game without referencing the menu, it is the most poorly organized, laziest feature to any video game I have ever played. This studio has had an entire decade to hone the menuing system in their RPG game, and the best thing they can come up with is a literal grab bag of items organized like a pile of clothes on a teenagers dorm room floor. I cannot tell you how many times I grabbed an item only to never use it in my play-through simply because I lost it in the menu. There is a lantern in this game, and I have to play Where's Waldo every single time I try to equip it simply because I picked something up on the ground in an open world RPG game, and it reshuffled my items.

Gameplay wise, its a souls game. That is to say, its a rhythm game that tries to cheese you every step of the way. In some ways, I find this rewarding, especially when facing groups of enemies in the games various dungeons. Assuming you have min/maxed your character to make the fight doable of course. Most of these encounters are well set up to challenge you to figure out a strategy to beat them consistently, given limited space and resources. Unfortunately, this is an open world game, and the majority of encounters occur in the open world. In these cases, it is easy to bypass encounters by going around them, or fighting them one on one. To make up for that, the game designers added lots of harder enemies that are required fights for one reason or another. All of these fights devolve into ""big guy with sword in field"" or ""big guy with axe in field"", and have basically the same move sets. The best way to deal with them is to grind levels until you can easily combo or one shot them, otherwise you're in for repetitive, uninspired fights. A majority of enemies are direct copy pastes of one another, and it's a shame.

It's a shame because the art might be the best I have seen in a video game. There are many biomes/areas to explore, and each their own unique artistic style to them. You can easily tell which area you are in just by the art style of the world around you. I visited every single area in this game simply because I wanted to explore the environment that the artists created, and I put up with all of repetitive gameplay and the obnoxious bosses to do it.

The bosses in this game suffer the same issue as the enemies. At least half are re-used throughout the game, the worst example being used at least 6 times. Many of them share similar move-sets as well, making the artistically unique bosses seem like copies of earlier ones. Put simply, fighting them is a chore. The bigger, ""demigod"" bosses are more unique, at least early in the game. But more often than not, they can only be defeated by a ""normal"" player by cheesing them. Multiple times in this game I have been impressed by a boss design, only to realize the best way to defeat them is an unsatisfying cheese that the game gives you as an apology for making their boss unbeatable at the level you are supposed to face them. Towards the end of the game, it becomes a boss rush, and there are no more cheese strategies available. In order to beat these, you need to enter into an hours long gameplay loop of getting one shot to each combo they throw out so you can learn the precise moment you need to dodge in order to avoid their attacks. If you grind hard enough, you can eventually see the ending to a game with zero story.

I played this game because a friend recommended it. They said they enjoyed it, and they hoped I did too, and then apologized for telling me I should play it. Many people on here have the same story, and many of their friends say they enjoyed the game as well. The only explanation I can come up with is that this game is Type 2 fun. When you are in the moment, playing the game, its terrible. Once you are done, and you've completed it, the feeling of accomplishment you get overshadows those moments of frustration, the monotony of grinding, and the times you left the game defeated. You commiserate with your friends, and it becomes a shared experience that you can connect with. Eventually you forget the negative feelings you had while playing the game, and the memories that persist are those of the adventure you embarked on, and the feeling of growth that came out of it.

But when I play this game, I can't help but wonder what I actually am supposed to get out of it. I pressed dodge the exact millisecond I needed to five times in a row, and won a boss encounter because of it. Was that worth it? Is practicing this one button press for an hour straight really what I'm doing with my time? More than anything, thing game makes me question why I spend time playing it instead of doing something else.

The first encounter in Elden Ring is with a hulking mass of thrashing bodies, congealed in a spider like blob of legs and arms. If it is your first playthrough, it easily dispatches you with a few swipes of its relatively tiny sword, shrugging off any damage you attempt to inflict. Veteran players, expecting the monster, can beat it with well timed dodges and strikes, though it is no easy feat. The reward for doing so is a short walk to a nearby pathway, where the ground gives out, killing you instantly. The same can be said for the game as a whole. No matter what you do, the end result is the same, you get nothing for your time, your energy, your frustration. In the end, it is a futile waste of effort.

Weapons like rivers of blood or moonveil are not obtained following some flashy quest or beating some god-ass boss, instead, u find them in the world organically.
 Every boss that u may find difficult has a weapon that could blow it to kingdom come and can be found with a little exploring.

2732,133565315,"It's been two and a half months now since I 100%'ed this game. I haven't had the urge to go back to it a single time since. I didn't hate the time I spent with it, but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it either. I had never played a FromSoftware game before – whenever I saw someone play one of their Souls-games I thought ""Wow that looks absolutely horrible and about as fun as going to the dentist."" And I didn't necessarily mean the difficulty (and more specifically the way in which they are ""difficult""), but also the aesthetics and how the movement and physics looked like.

But, given the absolutely insane hype levels for Elden Ring I decided to finally give one of them a shot. Unfortunately my intuition was correct: The movement does feel like you're controlling a semi truck on molasses. It just does not *feel* fun to do anything in this game, be it running around or fighting. I'm not talking about the way heavy vs. light loadouts feel, the very foundations of movement and physics in this game just don't appeal to me. Of course as a Souls-beginner it also took some getting used to, but that happened fairly quickly. I didn't have any trouble with it, but it's not something that would draw me to the game – which is problematic, considering that movement makes up most of the gameplay.

The other part, the aesthetics, also mostly didn't click for me just as I expected. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that the art direction in this game is very well done. (I do think that it's a tad bit overhyped, though – the game looks good, but it doesn't look great.) But with very few exceptions it is all just pain and despair, mud and dirt, darkness and gloom. There's not enough contrast between areas that are some variation of ""big end of the world mood"" and more light-hearted areas. I understand that this makes sense from a story perspective, but it's just not something I enjoy very much. Why would I want to spend 100+ hours in this utterly depressing hellscape, with no respite to make it all worth it?

Speaking of story… well. It certainly has some GRRM aspects to it, but not so much the good ones that gave us amazing stories well over a decade ago, but the ones that just drip feed the idea of something bigger and better still to come, pinky promise, anytime now! If you're lucky enough to even stumble upon some story, it's usually confusing and feels irrelevant/disconnected. I hate modern Ubisoft open world games as much as anyone else, but Elden Ring absolutely does not even come close to do this right in the way that Breath of the Wild did. The fact that most players will go to a Wiki to be able to figure out how to finish (or even find and begin…) quest lines is a scathing indictment of how badly the game fails at telling its stories.

The ""async coop"" did not click with me either. The ghosts of other players pretty much never revealed anything of interest to me. At best they could be ignored, at worst they were a distraction. Far worse are the hints, which gives a pretty good insight into the headspace of the fan base of this game. ""try finger but hole"" is their idea of peak comedy, and everyone falls over themselves making this same joke for the billionth time. More serious ones like ""enemy/treasure ahead"" are worthless as well, because you can never know if it is a troll or not. So you do check any nooks and crannies anyway – and there's nothing wrong with a game wanting you to do so, but what's the point of these hints then.

Finally, the difficulty. Yeah, it's pretty hard if you don't farm XP and overlevel yourself. The game does an okay job of being a difficult game. Considering that it's a fairly complex 3D open world game, you can't expect great loading times after you die, but the gameplay also isn't designed for dying as often and freely as for example something like Celeste – which lets you continue playing after death within milliseconds. There's a couple of spots that are just infuriating, though, mostly to do with elevators. Site of grace next to the elevator, you ride it up and there's an area where you most likely will die a whole bunch of times before getting through. Every damn time after dying and respawning at the site of grace you not only have to ride back up – you first have to call the elevator back down because it is still above from your earlier ride. Of course that is logical and ""correct"", but that doesn't make it any less annoying. Resetting an elevator next to a site of grace to be on your level upon respawning would have been such an obvious QoL improvement, but Elden Ring does not give you any of those. And hardcore fans will defend that as realism, or a counter to the oh so horrible hand-holding that games do these days. But that's bs. Little annoyances like that don't make a game harder or ""more real"", they just make it more annoying.

It's these kinds of things that make me think that Elden Ring was rushed out in the end, and I'm genuinely baffled by the praise it gets for supposedly being ""one of the good ones"" when compared to other AAA games and their need for day one patches. I didn't _mind_ the stuttering issues the game still has on PC, but they haven't even been fixed. I had _a ton_ of bugs and glitches and some crashes even. Nothing too bad or unexpected for a game of this scale, but Elden Ring is not some magic outlier here that does things much better or differently than other good AAA games, of which there is still plenty.

So, do I recommend this game? No, I personally do not. If your taste in games is like mine, you won't enjoy it very much. I don't regret my time with it, because now I know definitively that Souls-games just aren't for me. But that thumbs-down is not meant to say that it's a bad game, despite all my criticisms above. A lot of them are very subjective, and the ones that I'd say are a bit more objective aren't dragging the game down too much. I can absolutely understand why people love this game, but unfortunately I didn't.",2023-02-25 10:36:15,False,1,0,False,False,348,49,6357,0,6357,2023-01-10 23:44:27,1103,0.9937,positive,5 stars,0.4854705681403478

Elden Ring is certainly by far the game of all time.

Elden Ring offers the most important aspect of any video game: Actually gettin to flippin play it. (And LOTS of it.) The others have their reasons (I'm not getting into it), but it is always good to return to the roots of video games by focusing heavily on gameplay.
You wanna play a video game? You wanna play LOTS of gamin'? Then get this game.
Does it have flaws? Absolutely; quite a few. But the game is still well worth it, I think. Most of them are from a vet's perspective, so I can't say much. If you are new to the Fromsoft games, though, you should be much less irked by these things, assuming you even see any to begin with.

This game is NOT made for the PC, it is/was made strictly as a lesser game build for the consoles and it shows. The graphics are not as great as they should be on a PC title. In the first 25 hours the graphical tricks used are obvious and show through the facade of standard console tricks used to help consoles with their performance issues.

Another warning is the beyond nonsensical game interface, it was made strictly for a game pad, and it shows. While it is up to the developers to provide proper access and proper ports to the PC, the effort was minimal to the point the PC port of this game is a meme by itself in regards to the keyboard layout and interface choices and key binds.

While a huge number of people chime away with ""This is a souls title"" to wave away the criticism in regards to the poor PC keyboard layout and control options. I do not let these developers off the hook. The keyboard layout and UI suck in a big way. If you do not have a game pad, or do not like to use one, you will be at a disadvantage as there is no assigning any interface controls in a common sense layout. It took me quite a while to get used to the console style approach to minimalist, multi-function buttons in a rotary layout instead of the standard assign whatever action on whatever keystroke freedom I am used to.

Another part of the game I do not like is the forced pvp aspect with invasions or the multitude of notes that can be left. The notes clutter the areas, have questionable messages and do nothing for immersion. The invasions, even in a password protected setting is a very stupid choice on the part of the developers. it adds nothing to the game experience and actually degrades the games lore and entertainment values. 
These things are simply immature carrots for the drop in and drop out crowd and do nothing for the game itself except to let the worst in people ruin an otherwise good game experience. If you want to experience the game without these poorly executed interruptions, play offline, trust me on this.

If you are willing to re-learn a bunch of control movements and a very poor UI interface, the game does have a large world and a great challenge with tons of secrets. Though I feel a big part of that challenge is wading through the developers lazy design choices and not the story itself. Elden ring is not the first souls games and is a foray into the bigger RPG market in which it is a mild success. Recently Elden Ring began touting it's sales figures and not giving info on returns so i contacted them. I was told they do not give out that info.

[i]muhteşem[/i]

Bu incelemede hem Elden Ring'i yorumlayıp (spoiler olmadan) hem de yapımcı şirket ve tür benzediği için favori oyunlarımdan Sekiro ile karşılaştırmalar yapacağım.

Öncelikle Elden Ring'in devasa bir dünyası var, harita değil dünya. Açık dünya oyunlarının çoğunda olduğu gibi haritası bomboş/tekrarlama değil. Gittiğiniz her noktada işinize yarayacak farklı objeler bulabiliyorsunuz. Renk paleti bana soluk gelmedi, bazı yerler inanılmaz renklerde sonbaharı yaşarken bazı yerler olması gerektiği gibi karanlık.

Sekiro'da bu durum doğal olarak tamamen farklı çünkü lineer koridor mantığı olan bir oyun. [b]Haritada keşif yapma hissini Elden Ring inanılmaz başarılı yapmış.[/b]

[b]Oyunun yönetimi ve hikaye kısmında George R.R. Martin ile Hidetaka Miyazaki var haliyle doyurucu. Türe alışık olmayanlar için hikaye ilk başta bölük gelebilir, saatlerce hikaye namına ne bok yaptıklarını bilmeden etrafta gezebilirler.[/b] Souls oyunlarında oyunun hikayesini öğrenmek için önemli eşyaların açıklamalarına bakmalı, NPC'lerin senle veya diğer NPC'lerle konuşması varsa dinleyip parçaları birleştirmelisin. Girişte ana hikayeden biraz bahsedilse bile hikayeyi tepside sunmayacak. [b]Hikayede negatif olduğunu düşündüğüm şey birden fazla görev ağı bulunan NPC'ler. Bazı karakterlerin görevlerini devam ettirmek için kesinlikle internetten araştırmalısın, o kadar alakasız yerlerde bir şeyler yapman gerekiyor ki araştırmadan bulmak imkansız.[/b] Yapımcı Miyazaki zaten oyunlarının internette bol bol konuşulup hakkında fikir alışverişi yapılmasını isteyen bir tip.

Dövüş sistemine gelirsek oyun burada gerçekten işi senin tercihine bırakıyor. Birçok farklı build, sayısız silah seçeneği ile seçenekler çok geniş. Soulslike oyunlarına alışık değilseniz savaşırken yüzlerce kez ölebilirsiniz fakat mantığı oturttuktan sonra her şey kolaylaşıyor. Seviye mantığı olduğu için çok tokat yersen seviye kasıp gelme şansın var.

Sekiro'da dövüş hissiyatı kat kat daha iyiydi, elinde kumanda değil de kılıç tutuyorsun hissiyatını verebiliyordu. Elden Ring'de kesinlikle böyle bir seviye beklemeyin. Sekiro'dan sonra ağaç kesiyormuşsun hissiyatı veriyor.

Müzik konusunda ise [i]yeterli[/i] diyebilirim. Gerçekten epik bir savaşa girdiğini hissettirmeyi başarsa bile sonradan açıp dinleyeceğim bir albümü yok bence.

Bazı yorumlarda optimizasyondan bahsedilmiş fakat ben R5 5600x ve RX 6600 XT sistemimle maksimum ayarlarda fps düşüşü yaşamadan oynadım.

Sonuç olarak keşfedilmeye fazlasıyla değer bir dünya, oynadığım en akılda kalıcı oyunlardan biri.",2023-02-25 00:37:21,True,0,0,True,False,136,11,5211,1203,4845,2023-03-05 21:23:40,329,0.0,neutral,2 stars,0.44943372905254364

2876,133531095,"There's very few ways I could talk about this game that are unique or interesting, because enough ink's been spilled that even reviewing it feels trite. I've been following Fromsoft games for the better part of a decade, starting with buying Demon's Souls way back in 2011, just before Dark Souls dropped on the PS3. 

So I'll start by stealing words from someone who's smarter than I am, specifically Noah Caldwell-Gervais: ""Elden Ring is not a perfect game, but it is idiosyncratic, which is almost as good and just as rare.""

It's pretty remarkable that From Software's brand of animation timing-based combat, meticulous level design and striking art direction and tone not only translates to the open world format but even makes it truly worthwhile and interesting. The map is huge, but I still know its peaks and valleys, sheer cliff faces and miserable swamp lands like the back of my hand; I was concerned that the expansion of scope would mean it would be harder to get an idea of the layout of the Lands Between just because of its sheer breadth.

That's not the case because its layout is still every bit as crafted as any other fromsoft map. Sheer cliff faces from a map that dares you to traverse its landscape, jagged rock like fingers reaching out, as though the land itself wants to grab you, swallow you whole. I've never seen an open world so fearlessly use its verticality to limit the player's exploration and force you to find a way around. Sure there are games with taller skyscrapers, bigger mountains, but there's a difference between something being tall and something feeling tall. You can take an elevator to the top floor, but it means a lot more if you had to drag yourself around Mount Gelmir's smoking caldera. 

It's embedded in my mind, every inch, every facet, every corpse in Caelid, every freestanding structure in Liurnia...and yet despite how much I know, there's still so much I missed. It took me a year to find out about Albinauric pots, and I only looked it up because I got smacked by one when I was invading! 

Fromsoft has never been afraid to just hide things from the player; these games are utterly indifferent about whether or not you find every single item or every nook and every cranny and it makes me wish more titles were willing to just let the player miss things. I had a friend who had no idea there was an entire sector, a massive drop by an NPC just barely hidden; a huge chunk of a necropolis you can only visit towards the endgame. 

There are maybe a few complaints to be made about how the combat is put together (and there are degenerate playstyles out there, but that's kind of inevitable in a game with this much breadth), but I still think it's by far some of the best that Fromsoft has made. I would argue it's even better than Bloodborne's combat loop, partially because you don't have to hunt for vials, partially because there's just more variety. 

I won't go into the boss fights, mostly because you will know how Fromsoft's combat rhythm is if you play any of the other games. I would go so far as to say this is probably fromsoft's best boss lineup in a base game. If that sounds like hearsay, do keep in mind that even DS3 had way less consistency in boss quality, DS2's base lineup is truly terrible, and DS1 had both bosses that were kind of jank and a lot who were just...not very good. That's not even getting into DeS' lineup which is truly rough after 15 years of iteration. ER doesn't share that problem in its main lineup. Like, frankly the remembrance bosses, several of the optional fights, are all pretty consistently interesting to fight (save some truly insufferable lingering hitboxes. Looking at you, Fallingstar Beast.)

Elden Ring is three Dark Souls games stapled together, laid in a map with combat that takes queues from Sekiro and build variety that even exceeds DS2. It says a lot that even now, a year into this game's life cycle, I am still getting invades. 

I mean I'm not exactly going to convince anyone who wasn't already looking at this game and I'm not really gonna be swayed by discourse because I've had a long, long time to percolate my thoughts.

2885,133528369,"This is the Dark Souls II that FromSoft WANTED to make, as opposed to the one we actually got. It has many of the same annoyances—gank-heavy enemy placements, questionable hitboxes, a lot of fights seemingly being designed with only one strategy in mind—but it also corrects many of the worst aspects of DS2, and you actually get an entire continent to explore instead of a convolution of impossible spaces. If you liked DS2, you'll probably like ER—and if you didn't like DS2, as I and so many others didn't, there's still a very good chance you'll like ER anyway.

It's not a perfect game. The open world GENERALLY avoids feeling boring and empty like in many other open-world games—but some areas still feel like a slog. Enemy strength scales by area, just like in Dark Souls, not according to your level or equipment, which makes exploring some areas a bit more frustrating, but you can always hop on Torrent for a quick getaway—though that only applies to certain definitions of ""quick,"" because Torrent feels like the slowest horse in video games and turns like a boot. Still, he can double-jump, which allows for some interesting routes.

2907,133518104,"Do I recommend this game? Yes and no. Why the ""no""? It's not a game meant for everyone, and I mean that. It is a challenging game, and can be extremely frustrating at times. However, if you like to be challenged, if you enjoy the feeling after overcoming a difficult fight, then this is for you. 

The lore is not an in your face type of story. You've got to do some digging. I suggest reading item descriptions, it goes a LONG way in clarifying the story, as well as exploring and going off the beaten path. As someone who played DS3 (a LOT), I absolutely love this game and the story. It's dark, gritty, and most of all sad; but it is compelling. It draws you in and throws you for a loop.

Gameplay wise, it runs smoothly, and I have no issues. Controls are nearly the same as Dark Souls 3 (with the addition of jumping). I don't suffer from my game CTD'ing (crash to desktop) or anything.

In terms of style of play, there are a lot of different builds. More than just the spell slinger or sword and board styles. It's fun, interesting and I enjoy the freedom of it. Some builds (scarlet rot/bleed) are OP, that mainly applies to multiplayer/pvp and less so for solo play.

This game has some of the most frustrating design I've ever seen in a From Soft game. Feels a lot more like a statement than it does an enjoyable video game.

Open world is really cool but it means you're always going to be over geared or over leveled for half the game. Don't bother unless you're doing co-op (which case I'd recommend the Seamless Co-op mod since it uses the same outdated co-op design from the other dark souls games, as well as you can't use the horse in multiplayer).",2023-02-24 14:52:20,False,6,0,True,False,590,11,4111,102,4111,2023-02-24 14:46:01,111,0.8176,positive,3 stars,0.4152400344610214

2990,133477263,"I'll start off by saying I've been enjoying Dark Souls since DS1. Fromsoft makes some excellent games and this game is good, but my negative review comes from a few things I don't enjoy and I don't think the series needed.

We didn't need a open world. It's as wide as an ocean and shallow as a puddle. I prefer the old linear experience that Dark Souls has always provided. I also stand that I wish we could get back to the inter connectivity that DS1 demonstrated so excellently.

I become incredibly disappointed when I clear a side dungeon only to fight a boss I previously killed. It ruins the excitement of finding something new only to experience something old. The reuse of bosses in this game kills the experience for me.

The boss design is also another factor in my review. I've always been a hyper aggressive player. I look for openings in between attacks while still being able to roll dodge as well. I'm aggressive and hate playing passive. I enjoy optimizing and looking for zero downtime if possible. That said, these bosses will string together a Marvel Vs Capcom string for 30 seconds and I'm just stuck standing away and looking at the boss like I'm stupid. After that string they have almost zero downtime and begin to run the string once again. It's not fun to constantly be dodging for 30+ seconds only to maybe hit once or twice.
 
In closing, we sacrificed quality for quantity. The game has the highest highs of the series followed by devastatingly low lows that ruin it for me.",2023-02-24 09:35:07,False,6,0,False,False,251,44,10308,6768,7587,2023-03-05 23:48:18,269,-0.9871,negative,3 stars,0.5858806173006693

There are virtually unlimited ways to play from the massive amounts of items, weapons, spells, gear, etc plus customization of your character and their skills. The world is absolutely massive with more secrets and questlines than you could ever hope to discover or complete. The messaging system was weird to me at first as I'm the type of player that loves to discover everything on my own, but I think it actually adds to the game due to the sheer volume of secrets. If a lot of the messages weren't there I'd probably have half the gear I have now and still be stuck somewhere in Limgrave. 11/10 and I haven't even finished my first playthrough yet.

- Fantastic OST
- Excellent voice acting and great boss voice lines
- Loads of locations to explore, bosses to fight, non-intuitive quest lines to pursue and gear, weapons, spells etc. to perfect your build.

Best game that truly made me feel something. Even that something was fear, doubt, uncertain and anxious and finally conquering that fear made me move forward as a person. Definitely recommend for all people who love a challenge and work on themselves to overcome those challenges.

There are mods available to make the experience easier for you. I recommended a co-op mod that makes it easier to play without invasions and easy mode mod that makes the game little bit easy for your skills. I do recommend checking the game out without mods first and try different builds(There are a lot of busted builds)

FromSoft have truly outdone themselves with this game. Dark souls was always unforgiving and a depressing world i could never get into. Things don't make sense in dark souls in a common sense perspective and how alien the world building is. The same is true for Elden Ring but it's a lot less and oh my god the game is gorgeous.

Even after all of that time, there are still many things to find and I'm still finding neat new stuff even after beating it.

Elden Ring's world is just teeming with things to find! In fact I feel as though Elden Ring has done something that many other open world games have failed at, which is making the player WANT to explore everywhere, and rewarding the player for doing so with things like weapons, spells, armor, charms. extra bosses, and even hidden quests, and stories!

3165,133432046,"I strongly recommend this game for anyone who is looking for an adventure and enjoys looking for things!  I have spent the last 11 hours of game play exploring, dying, killing, gathering, learning, and having fun overall.  I was unsure about this game when it first came out and was hesitant to pick it up.  I am glad that I bought the game and have had a chance to experience it! Even if you have never played a ""souls"" like game... you should give this a try.. very fun! 

I have enjoyed the open play and open world.  You can explore and stumble upon things that will either kill you, bless you or reward you with items.  There are many different npcs to discover, mobs that you can easily kill or come back to when you are stronger.  The world is amazing!  You can hear the ocean waves crash against the shore, the thunder of water against the cliffs, you can actually see whitecaps and waves make their way to the shore.  I still have much to discover and do. 

You get a selection of classes to play that can be customized to fit your own style so there is no ""cookie cutter"" build.  You get to choose how you want to play your given class and the weapons, skills etc.  If you want to be a magic wielding rogue, it looks like it could be done.  I am not sure how viable or survivable it would be but you have the option to do as you please.  

I really have no negative things to say about this game.

I have only just started the game... keep your eyes & ears open. Be alert and if you die... you die.  Make sure to level up every chance you get.. don't hoard your souls you may get caught off guard by a big bad boss and not have a way to retrieve them. It is a risk you take!

3180,133428296,"Elden Ring, developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco, has been eagerly anticipated by fans of the studio's previous games, such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. From early impressions and gameplay footage, Elden Ring appears to deliver on the studio's signature style of challenging gameplay, immersive worlds, and cryptic storytelling.

One of the most notable aspects of Elden Ring is its open-world design, which is a departure from the more linear levels of FromSoftware's previous titles. This new approach promises to provide players with a greater sense of exploration and discovery as they venture through the game's expansive environments.

In addition, Elden Ring features a deep and complex lore, which has become a hallmark of FromSoftware's games. The game's story is said to be written in collaboration with renowned fantasy author George R.R. Martin, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the game's narrative.

Elden Ring also boasts a range of new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to mount and ride various creatures, adding a new dimension to exploration and combat. The game's combat system, which is a staple of FromSoftware's games, has been refined and expanded upon, with new weapons, spells, and abilities to master.

Overall, Elden Ring appears to be a promising addition to FromSoftware's impressive catalog of games. With its open-world design, deep lore, and refined gameplay mechanics, the game is sure to appeal to fans of the studio's previous titles as well as newcomers to the genre.

La alta dificultad y la dinámica de ""morir y volver a intentarlo"" me resultaba un tanto frustrante. Lo cual no deja de ser curioso teniendo en cuenta que crecí jugando a juegos como Megaman, Contra, Ninja Gaiden, etc. que se basaban precisamente en eso. Será la edad ... Creo que el gran acierto de Elden Ring es combinar lo mejor de los Dark Souls con un mundo abierto. Esa libertad que te da un gigantesco mundo abierto permite que cuando te quedes atascado con una quest, puedas avanzar en otra distinta, explorar una zona pendiente, o tratar de acabar con ese dragón que te estaba dando quebraderos de cabeza hace unos días. Ello hace que el juego sea más gratificante de lo habitual. Ello, junto con varias mejoras a nivel técnico y de mecánicas, es lo que, en mi opinión, sublima la fórmula ""Dark Souls"" en este juego hasta convertirlo en una Obra Maestra.

I couldnt get into 1st dark souls and i gave up on trying any other souls coz im mostly casual person but i liked how this game looked and decided to give it a try.

It was very hard at first but slowly i managed to beat first bosses from small dungeons and before i noticed i was spending alot time ingame.
Best feature for me was that i didnt had to fight boss to continue playing, if something was too hard i always could go and do other things to get stronger and return more prepared.
Aftter getting better at game i even started to beat stuff without help of summon spirits and it felt super awesome to achive that.

3231,133408992,"2011 saw the release of two of the most influential games for the RPG genre, Dark souls and Skyrim. One was a complex and mysterious game, with some of the greatest level designs in modern gaming and the other was an adventure through a seemingly limitless fantasy world. Both were fantastic games in their own right, but even back then I always dreamed of a Skyrim with the addictive combat and difficulty of dark souls, and likewise I dreamed of a dark souls that had the sandbox freedom of Skyrim.

Fast forward to 2022 and this dream has been realised. The open world element of Elden Ring reinvigorates the souls-like core gameplay. The great level design and inter connectivity of dark souls is still here, and so is the great combat and progression. But now we have a huge open world full of secrets to uncover. In dark souls sometimes the difficulty could be suffocating, with your only option to “get gud” and grind your way through a cruel place like Sen’s Fortress. In Elden Ring when things get hard you can teleport across the map and set off in a direction of your choosing. Leveling up while uncovering lore rich dungeons and points of interest. It honestly never even feels like grinding.

This game still isn’t for everyone, if you’re looking for a game that is completely accessible and has the best graphics of the decade, this might not be it. But if you’re even slightly willing to give the souls-like combat a decent try, and if you love fantasy RPGs this is absolutely the best game of its kind since 2011.",2023-02-23 11:44:07,True,0,0,True,False,468,32,6861,0,6861,2022-05-05 11:48:42,273,0.9958,positive,4 stars,0.46369771162668866

However if your looking for an addictive game to sink hours into, then its a candidate but you still need a walk through.  I cant recommend as a game - it has nothing on Skyrim or Witcher or DragonAge or MassEffect but I get if you like the soul games this would be ideal.  New to the game style, with a wrench 1/10, with a Samurai 5/10 I would give.

3251,133403001,"Elden Ring is the culminative mastering of Fromsoft's design for the past decade on top of treading new grounds in the form of an open world with horizontal progression compared to past games which were much more linear in design. It is unabashedly masterful in execution; it feels like the Soulsborne series was always meant to reach this.

By far this is the game where it is the easiest to get into; progression gating is very limited, most of the map is accessible without the need to defeat bosses. There is a plethora of play-styles that are viable; Miracle builds are now finally made viable, its on that level. The Spirit Ashes add a new option for solo play that's more available for players to use.

The story feels much more cohesive and fleshed out than any previous Fromsoft game that I have experienced. Not going to drop spoilers, but its amazing how things feel connected as you progress through the story.

There are a few prominent pain points. There is some reusing of bosses, which in an open world game is perfectly fine, however there are instances where they are poorly placed, such as two different instances of a boss enemy with different movesets in a small arena, which makes the encounter feel arbitrarily difficult. There are a few enemies that are less than enjoyable to fight as well, and there is a big difficulty spike in the later areas. However these are relatively minor flaws that can be circumvented.

Elden Ring feels like a childhood dream of adventure. Its easy to lose yourself to the adventure. Take it from me; game already ate up 100+ hours in the first week. To the veterans of the Soulsborne games, this is a worthwhile purchase. To the newcomers, this is probably the best first game for the series, it will take some learning but if you really want to get into souls games, this is one.",2023-02-23 08:40:25,True,0,0,True,False,70,1,13860,0,13860,2023-02-12 15:49:49,325,0.9831,positive,4 stars,0.5911626666784286

3323,133391978,"I will start off with, the game is fun and it is worth playing if you are new to the Souls series, or you suck at the Dark Souls games.. but...
I don't get it.Id rather go back and play Dark Souls 3 personally.. 

I have easily several Hundred hours in DS1. well over 2000 in DS2 and at least the same amount in DS3. I don't get it.

Elden Ring is not that great. After nearly 200h I can confidently say, Dark Souls was Better.
The game is clearly made for Casuals, and the combat is kind of Braindead easy when you aren't being cheap shotted by a Boss with a mechanic that is unavoidable. Like, a lot of enemies will attack you as you are recovering from a Knockdown, hitting you BEFORE the animation even ends of you standing up, making you unable to avoid it. and that is the only thing you need to learn.. once you learn how to avoid the cheap shots.. the game becomes trivial.

In the Souls Series, there were virtually no Cheap shots.. this game is littered with them, giving it Artificial difficulty. These things make it Seam difficult, but its really not.
9/10 Bosses in this game I can literally just sit there and Charged-Heavy the Boss to death with Caesti, no need to Dodge or avoid at all. Even with my Insane Regen build in past games, I never could do this. I get up to over 1000 AR with FISTS. FISTS! I can get a Guaranteed 3 hit combo off on another Player that deals a total of 3k damage, before Defenses.. even after defenses, most people are Dead after that... 

they Ruined Poise. While it is nice to have DS 1 and 2 Passive Poise back, even at Max Poise you can only survie 2 swings from a Longsword or equivalent. Anything Bigger still 1 tap staggers. 

If you just spec for Jumping Attacks, congrats! you beat the game. 
The Open World is nice, but it really  doesn't offer much after the 1st playthrough. 
in the 1st Play through, the open world is fun and exciting. in the NG+x Playthroughs, its tedious and actually annoying to have to constantly navigate. 
80% of this game is not mandatory to get to the next playthrough, as opposed to the Souls games, where it was the exact opposite.
It is an interesting take, but since 80% of the game is just useless past the 1st playthrough, whats the point? You will get through NG+ in like 30 mins.. Its really not all that.

The Ashes of War system is amazing and opens a lot of Options. Maybe in the future we get another game that gives us the option for actual Skills instead. 

If you don't want to go Punch enemies for 1k damage at level 70 and up, just go mage... you can nuke anything from Players to Bosses as a mage and they cannot do anything about it. 

Dont get me wrong, the Game is fun.. its just nowhere near as good as any of the People here want you to believe. 
there are Detrimental bugs that will piss you off in PvP, like a Bug to increase Rivers of Bloods Phantom reach by like 100x. And its damage doubles as well.

Considerable amount of hackers are also still existing in the game. 


all in all, this is a perfect game for the Dark Souls Novice, and the Casuals that don't feel ready to enter the Tryhard community of the actual Souls games.  but be prepared to know that most people are actually rather casual in this game, especially in PvP.. even in the Arenas, most ppl seem rather casual :/ RIP Dark Souls PvP standards",2023-02-23 03:00:07,True,0,0,False,False,51,12,10759,32,10727,2023-03-06 16:31:17,627,-0.8488,negative,2 stars,0.44781413674354553

On every play through I find more areas and items that I had not found previously.  Even after 400 hours, I still find massive areas and fierce bosses that guard unknown treasure.

The graphics are beautiful, the sound design is top notch, and the controls are tight.
I would recommend using a wired controller, because you will notice even the slightest input lag.  

This game will punish insanity.  But, if you are able to refine your tactics you will feel a sense of accomplishment from victory that is unparalleled.

Sure you will get frustrated.  There will be times it feels unfair.  But there is always another approach to any situation.

I would not say that Elden Ring is ""Hard"" but survival does require your full attention at all times.  

It is absolutely worth every penny.  Elden Ring has ruined every other RPG for me.  It is Pandora's box.  

Beware, this game will destroy your life.  It will become an obsession.  And you will never be the same.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

- interesting story
- lots of challenge; seriously git gud or get out (i learned this the hard way). When you meet something new just run. 
- You will die a lot but dont get frustrated but take it as a journey, as some youtube guide said. 
- the views and details are just beatiful
- atmosphere really beatiful
- some cutscenes (of the very few that there are) are really astonishing. 
- first i was gonna put this in the bad stuff but; no quest directions, you need to figure out everything by youself. but then again it makes this more interesting even if it causes frustration. 
Bad stuff
- the story itself is interesting but it's shallow and there is no great immersion with it. Missing storytelling/cutscenes/etc.. Expected way more.
- lots of repetetive dungeons
- grinding (well this is sorta acceptable)
- XBOX-world. whole thing is planned for consoles and not pc. causes irritation with controls and movement.

3466,133363952,"Before this game, the only From Software game I had played was Sekiro. So I came into the game expecting something similar, just with a new backdrop. I don't know how they fucked it up, but this is leaps and bounds worse of an experience. Compared to its contemporaries, the combat is slow and unintuitive. There's a lot of fucking around with your build and other RPG elements (which is fine if that's what you're looking for). Coming from the simplicity of the Sekiro combat system, it is a lot to take in.

There are blatant levels of polish that have not been applied here. Weapon textures clip on your back, the platforming is abysmal (though sparse), there is no pause feature, you can't see the enemy's stance meter for some reason, and other little details that add up. The one small thing that peeves me the most is the lack of an indication that you're going to backstab someone. In Sekiro this big red icon comes up that tells you ""hello this is going to be a one hit kill,"" but in elden ring I got to give the guy a rimjob because I don't want to accidentally hit him with a light attack.

I do enjoy how the open world is handled, every time you get to a checkpoint it points a big arrow in the direction it wants you to go in so you're not fucking around lost all over the place. It takes the best of both worlds in that way (being linear and open world storytelling).

This make it all the more fun to challenge the game's difficulty. Difficulty in this game is set up in a way that makes it easier or harder depending on however the player decides to prepare themselves for something, due to the open world nature of Elden Ring. This makes it, in my opinion, the easiest game FromSoft has created to get into for a new player.

Overall, this game is an instant classic. And is meant to be played along with some helpful lookups. The game is designed with the community in mind, and you can see it with the integration of player messages in the game.

Play it for the gameplay, stay for the Vaati's lore videos. Don't bother with PvP, there are always tryhards with dual naginata's poking you from a mile away, and from barely does enough to balance that.

The most accessible souls title. You can completely trivialise the difficulty of this game, or roleplay a character, who is going to have a tough time.

-Incredible Weapons and Builds (speaks for itself)
-Sick bosses and enemies
-Well designed areas, love Limgrave and Caelid and Lurnia of the Lakes is a slight big below both of them but so far I love them all.
-Super Satisfying

Cons:
-Some supper annoying bugs such as the stuttering that still occurs a full year after release which is just embarrassing, can really get on my nerves because it always happens at the worst times. 
-They should make multiplayer easier (not because I'm bad but because it would just be nicer to have that way, but I've seen opposing opinions saying it ruins the ""souls-like"" part of it but come on man its annoying to have to have a limited number of summons to do things)

It Began with a beautiful customizable character being able to choose your class and your keepsake I decide to choose wretched and no keepsake as I didn’t fully understand what that was yet. A beautiful opening making me feel excited to get into gameplay. I spawn in a church wondering what I should do next taking my time until I find the item needed. Making my way out of the church I quickly run into the first boss shaking with excitement not knowing how to attack even roll I quickly died. Waking up in a cave I run to a double door and open it seeing a grace waiting for me just past. Finally making my way up on the elevator opening the gate to see the vast world of the Lands Between. Quickly being insulted by an NPC saying that Im maidenless I assault him I lose over and over again until I finally kill him. Feeling accomplished I run over to the first church and run into the Tree Sentinel. Words can’t describe how many times I have tried to kill that boss and failed. I feel as if every input I made was not my choice but as if it was his choice that I was going to do a jumping heavy and positioned himself perfectly to not only dodge my attack but get two attacks on me. Try and try again, I said to myself, not knowing that this would be the hardest boss I would ever fight.

After having to pay way too much just to be there, you're treated to a lengthy, boring wait. Although it's dull as fuck, you try to occupy yourself by looking around the room for anything remotely attention-keeping. Time eventually drips by, and you finally find yourself called to take the written test.

You happen to be pretty familiar with traffic laws, but some of the questions aren't even in English. That's too fucking bad, it's not there to hold your hand. Since making more than three mistakes will result in you failing, you find yourself having to bare all the boredom and dreariness of the wait, over and over again.

Hopefully you git gud at driving enough to memorize all of your wrong choices thus far, and by sheer will and refusal to move on, finally pass the written test. You will, at this point, have access to the next uneventful wait; The road test...with a tractor. The process will repeat itself ad infinium until it simply cannot be failed.

Finally, after X number of loops through hell, you can finally walk away victorious, having outlasted the DMV and all its bullshit.

3634,133311536,"So, before I even begin, let me clarify some stuff

I tried Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3, and hated all of them. I don't mean they're bad games, I definitely agree they're among the greatest series of all time and are an example to follow in terms of philosophy. But the gameplay is just not for me.

I played Sekiro, almost reached the end but eventually dropped out long enough for me to become too rusty to actually finish it. But I enjoyed it a lot!


So, what about Elden Ring? Well, just have a look at my hours on record and check the achievements on my steam profile. You'll see that I have... quite a different opinion !

To make it simple:

[h1] YOU. CAN. BEAT. IT. [/h1]

It is hard. Oh god is it hard. 188 hours of struggle and difficulty. But damn did I enjoy every single one of them.

Overall, it's your typical dark souls gameplay and experienced, but streamlined, improved and with a more intense and dynamic approach. Your moveset has so much more variety, and weapons are all so diverse (and every weapon type is viable!) that you will definitely find a playstyle that will suit you (mine was two greatswords, jump attack spam and I loved it).

But the main thing that made a huge difference for me was the open world. Not because I like open worlds in particular, but because that meant if a boss was too hard for me I could just leave and come back later with better gear and a higher level.

Just trust me, it's the most accessible Soulsborne game you'll find. it's actually great.",2023-02-21 21:03:03,True,2,0,False,False,106,5,11283,0,11283,2023-02-16 21:49:29,279,0.9773,positive,3 stars,0.45038993159929913

Every corner of the world feels alive with potential, and every encounter feels like a new challenge to overcome.

But beyond its gameplay, Elden Ring tells a compelling and deeply philosophical story about the nature of power, ambition, and the consequences of our actions. It's a game that rewards patience and reflection, asking players to consider their choices and the impact they have on the world around them.

Overall, Elden Ring is a masterpiece that will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest games of all time.

3709,133288694,"There are things done RIGHT:
The Open World is intruiging,
Combat feels great,
It runs fantastic,
The World looks GORGEOUS,
There are some areas inside the Open World that are legitimately INSANE,
The Mobs, Bosses and NPCs are well desgined,
The Sounddesign is good and weapons, attacks, etc all are fantastic

However this can't carry the negatives I found with this game:

Feeling Lost: I know it's a meme, but hear me out. I literally SKIPPED the tutorial by accident. I walk here: ""oh the enemies are too hard, you need to go elsewhere"" my friends tell me. Well so I did. I walk there: Now I'm oneshotting everything since I was MEANT to go there much earlier. That is no fun. How should I know which level of  ""hard but fair"" is acceptable? No idea. 
I wanted to play this game blind, but I literally could not - I would've quit the game 5 hours into it if I had no friends to teach me. I frequently find myself asking: ""can I fight this one?"", ""Am I supposed to be here?"", or ""How do I find X?"".""Go find out for yourself!"" say my friends. ""The game tells you when you are not meant to be here"", they say.
This is where I don't agree: No guidence at all lets me feel lost, clueless, I had no idea on how to do basic things, sometimes I'm overlevelled, sometimes I'm underlevelled. Elden Ring, for the love of god, is HORRIBLE at communicating information to the player. I know you all are down to BASH hand-holding the player, but SOME guidence should be given. And NO, The questlines and storylines all don't make sense and are rather missleading, sometimes leading you to areas you most certainly shouldn't be, to be fully honest. Being Open World makes this problem 10x more apparent. Let's talk more about that.

Variety: Going Open-World has it's problems. I frequently find myself uninterested in the exact same Dungeons, Bosses, Boss-Rooms, Enemies. The entire copy-paste of some sections had me feeling disappointed. This hits much harder because I know they CAN do better. Some of the most breathtaking areas I've ever experienced are in this game. But you can't fully build the Open World on these areas, right? Well you just have to look at other Souls games to recognize that this is very possible. A lot of bosses also get reused or become normal Mobs - which apparently is normal? I'm not getting exited anymore when seeing (most) BOSSES. Think about that.
Meta is also a big part of Variety. I personally have no idea about this stuff tbh, but I frequently heard about meta builds being broken or nessassary to defeat harder bosses, PVP-builds all being the same, etc. This hurts the integrity and one of the best aspects of the game: play however you want.
Point proven: Elon Musk literally got flamed and people wrote articles about him for using an ""off-meta"" build. wtf?
I'm HEAVILY discouraged of doing so, because X is most broken, ,Y is nessassary to beat stuff or, going to my next point, I levelled Z.

Limitation: Some limitation is very good and welcomed. However I REALLY dislike how weapons and Arts are Stat-Locked. How come I defeat the X-Dungeon or boss, wasting hard-earned Stone-Keys to play them, just to come out with a lackluster experience and a weapon I can't use? This feels genuinely HORRIBLE. Yes, I've been told I can respec, but 1) I have literally no idea how (feeling lost), and 2) I can do this only a limited amount of times.
And no, I don't want to REPLAY the entirety of Elden Ring because, and this is the singular reason my friends replay this game, I want to try a new build. This seems INSANE to me.

It's unfair: Some Bosses and Mobs felt very unfun to play against (don't get me started about this invisible dude). I don't really want to waste 6 hours for the TUTORIAL BOSS. So what did my friends do? (this was one of the biggest mistakes I've done); we cheesed a Mob way beyond my league (but accessible for some reason; that doesn't make sense), giving me an INSANE amount of Levels. I've become overlevelled to the point where I still first-try bosses 40 hours into it. As a Newbie to Souls-Games. That doesn't feel right nor fun. Hearing that the lategame gets worse, with frequently more unfair enemies, I feel very discouraged to go on. 
I came into Elden Ring and wanted a ""Hard but Fair"" game, but this couldn't be further from what I've experienced. 

Story: I literally have no Idea why I play this game on a story-perspective. I know I want to be this Elden Lord, go to that Tree or whatever, but that's about it. The only reason I kept playing is because I want to find special places, see something I didn't see before. It comes down to everything feeling VERY confusing. I have this quest where I needed to go down a well to find some NPC. The Well-part was rather easy, but down there and without guidence by my friends I would've probably searched for a bit - then I found him and CAN'T EVEN PROCEED this questline. ""The next part is out of my reach for some time"" my friends tell me, seeing no problem with that.

Multiplayer: Multiplayer was a mistake. It's frequently laggy, It takes AGES to play together,  it's very limited and there are exploits that feel like straight up cheating. This shouldn't be the way you play this game imo. PVP is also very unfun, running into the same builds a lot of times (""YO It's another Guts-Build""- my friends shout in exitement). This is a personal point to be fair, but let it be mentioned here. This game is far better enjoyed in Single Player.


This is where I stand: I intentionally didn't go deep into the positives to prove my point but trust me: This game got GREAT things going for it. That's why I'll keep playing after all. It's far better than many Triple A titles (which is not hard to be fair). I first thought Souls-Games are just not my type of game, but I've disproven that by liking other souls-games I've played recently. I've truely thought I'm a noob, that the game is too hard because... well... I'm too bad. But that wasn't true aswell.
I've finally stopped giving it the benefit of the doubt, ""breaking my silence"" one might say, and saw it for what is it: A great game with huge deal-breakers and impossible problems to solve. It's near impossible to play this game without any help, it lacks direction, multiplayer is bad, the story is a confusing mess, the Open World hurts the game more than it does good. This game is far from being the masterpiece people praise it to be.

Battling is as difficult as you want it to be, I am yet to encounter a situation where I feel trapped in having to overcome some kind of an impossible challenge. Can't win for some time? Go do something else, level up, find new gear, improve your skill, then come back and have a fair fight. Considering there is always something new to do and discover - it never feels grindy.

3718,133286432,"As a long time fan of Fromsoftware's modern output, Elden Ring has easily became my favorite next to Sekiro (though, you can't really compare these two). I'm not going really dwell on each aspect of the game as a whole, so I'm just going to say some helpful tips:

* PERFORMANCE
Performance isn't really good, but it goes away after a while and by the time I went deeper into the game it was for the most part resolved. It does leave a bad first impression though sadly, and I'm generally disappointed at Fromsoftware for this, but in the end I kind of forgot about it since it really starts to go away after a while (it's classic shader stutter apparently).
If this is really upsetting but you do want to keep playing, here are some tips:
- Try going offline, it doesn't help much, but it's worth a shot
- If you have enough memory, try setting shader cache to a higher value in your GPU setting
After a while it's easy for the game to lock on 40-50 in the open world and 60 in dungeons on recommended specs, but I won't say that this is ideal, it's easily the weakest aspect of the game.

* GAMEPLAY TIPS
If you are yet to play the game, here are my tips that I think can improve your experience (especially if this is your first Fromsoftware game):

- Pay absolutely no attention to the ""Meta"", meta is the enemy of fun. It's quite easy to build really high damage builds in this game, especially towards the end. Just pick up something that you like for early to mid-game. You do need to at least somewhat prioritize higher damage in the end-game though, but by that time, you'll probably have more than enough tools on your hand.

- There are quite a few multi-enemy bosses in the game. Don't treat them like O&S in Dark Souls, they were clearly never designed with the intention of you fighting them solo (which is a shame really). Summon a spirit, and if you do want to keep things ""fair"", remember that you can summon your spirit back by using the same item for summoning after the fight becomes one on one. Remember that spirits are an actual part of your build, rather than just some tools on the side. Once again, forget the meta, use whatever you like.

- Also on spirit summons, if you think that your summon is ""stealing the fight"" from you, there is talisman called ""Shabriri's Woe"" that you can get early game. Put that on, and the boss will prioritize you over your summon. It's surprising how well the summons can support you this way, while keeping you in control of the fight.

- Have multiple weapons with varying levels of upgrade. The game showers you with upgrade material just by clearing the major dungeons, and most of your damage comes from upgrade level instead of your stats. As long as you have the minimum stats and the correct infusion on the weapon, you'll have a pretty reliable weapon on hand. The reason that I suggest this is that it's quite easy to miss major areas and become over-leveled for those areas. Of course, the game has no problem with you destroying bosses, but if you do want a challenge, switch to a lower upgrade weapon, that'll be more than enough to level the field.
Beyond that, it's just fun having multiple weapons to use in this game.

- Horse combat is almost completely optional to engage in. There are fights that I personally think are much more enjoyable with the horse, but there is no force on you to do that. If you do end up using the horse, I recommend you use a halberd or a long weapon. Short weapons just don't work on your horse if you are moving fast (at least I couldn't make them work).

- Don't sleep on the Ash of War system. Some of them are really useful. You can make entire playthroughs around some of these ashes (like the magical parry thingy ... or the one that restores your health when you hit someone). The infusion also means that you can use many weapon classes effectively. This is quite different from Dark Souls or Bloodborne, you really aren't bound to a class of weapons based on your build, and the game I will go as far to say, expects you to roleplay as different builds frequently. 

- The crafting system isn't really that much in depth, but some of the consumables like Volcano Pots can completely melt some enemies; It's really funny. Give it a try once, if it doesn't interest you, then just forget it exists ...

- Invest at least a *bit* in Faith. Like maybe up to 12 or 15. Some incantations serve only defensive purposes, and are extremely useful in the end game, when the enemy damage becomes ridiculous. If not for that, just take a look at Lake of Rot ... you'll thank me later.

- On topic of defense, this is the first time I think your armor actually matters. Not only in the end game, but even as early as mid game, you can start getting chunked for like half your health quite easily if you are not careful. So either wear good armor, or use defensive talismans.

- There are a few ""holes"" on the map that the game gives you (like little brown circles ...), make sure you check them out. They are mines that usually always have bell bearings that you can trade in the hub for infinite supply of upgrade materials. Don't miss them.

3724,133285077,"Man, what a game. 

This is my first introduction into the 'souls like' scene and I personally really enjoy this type of style. 
Ever since I started playing Elden Ring, I always wanted to keep at it, even though I was getting absolutely flattened by everything, which is something incredibly rare. 

Basically, in this game, you start out in this incredibly detailed open world where you play as a “Tarnished” of no renown, who is blessed by the guidance of grace, and your compelled to make the journey through The Lands Between and become ""Elden Lord.""

Elden Ring has a variety of boss battles (of course) that are uniquely hard and challenging in their own way, in other words, you never get bored. The sheer size of the map is incredible with separate underground areas, catacombs, caves tones of other stuff. 

Elden Rings' game play is nothing like iv'e ever seen before and it's really awesome. I find that your always dealing with enemies who are stronger than you, introducing a high risk high reward concept.  

Also, be prepared to open your browser because there's so much stuff that I found difficult and was confused about when playing this game, its just so complex. (Just for reference I've played this game for 190 hours and I still haven't explored everything.) 

I have experienced a lot emotions while playing this game, one of them being anger, a lot of it. But when you finally defeat that boss that you needed to kill to progress, it is so rewarding and makes you feel really good about yourself. 

In conclusion, Elden Ring is by far the best experience i've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. And simply put, the best game ever.

3743,133279939,"Given all the hype this game received, well, eventually I should probably learn to not trust ""professional"" game reviewers.  I'm not sure if this is the studio's first open world game, but it sure feels like it.  It's a bland and boring (but beautiful) world with no direction and incredibly repetitive mechanics that become boring after the second dungeon you go through.  You don’t need direction in a linear game like dark souls (rather, its linear nature IS the direction).  But open world games need at least some of it.
Given all the hidden secrets in this world, I can tell just how much effort the devs put into crafting it.  But with how they just point you in a vague direction and say “go kill that boss to advance!”, they utterly fail their lovingly crated world by not giving the user any real reason to explore it.  I saw a lot of reviewers saying that you should use a notepad with this game to keep track of side quests because there is not quest log.  If your players are having to use external tools to keep track of something in the game, that’s a failing on the game’s part.  It does not add to the experience or mystique of the game.  In fact, it detracts, since you have to consciously put the game aside to take notes.  I didn’t get far enough into the game to really judge how much you’d have to use the wiki to find secrets and solve puzzles, but if what little I did get is an indication of the rest of the game, then another symptom of the lack of direction is just how often people have to search online to figure out how to find something or what to do next.  Again, if your players are have to use external tools to play the game, it’s a failing of the game.

I've yet to find any appreciable story after 15 hours of play.  And no, a few lines of dialogue every now and then are NOT story.  They're a pathetic attempt to pretend to have a story.  Maybe if I played longer, I'd see more interesting content and more story, but if I'm not seeing any real story even after I down the first major boss, I do not count that as having a story.  It's flavor text, at most.

As a final note on the negatives:  This is a lazy console port.  Framerate is capped at 60, Field of View is too narrow for computer screens, and not adjustable.  Interface is taken directly from the console, and that's almost never a good thing for a PC game.  Control scheme has terrible pre-bound keys, and commands that should really be split between multiple keys on a PC are bound together.  Additionally, there are a number of commands that can not be re-bound.  Number keys can not be bound to any commands.  And there's probably more that I'm forgetting about.  This game is playable with a kb/mouse, would probably be better with a controller, but REALLY needed a interface/control rework for PC.

As for the last part, let me preface this by saying it does NOT factor into my negative review, because I know many people very much so enjoy the souls-like model.  This was my first souls like game, and it turns out I do NOT enjoy the punishing mechanics that you have to corpse drag through to learn fights.  I get that others do, and I won't review it negatively because of that.  Though piece of advice, if you think you won't like the punishing challenge of the souls-like model, do not buy a souls-like game, you'll just be miserable.  If you don't have really good reactions, you won't be able to handle combat in this game.  People say git gud, and that's the kind of game this is.  I just have no interest and do not enjoy it.  Again, this is not why I'm giving the game a negative review, just a warning to anyone who might be looking to try the souls like model.",2023-02-21 08:36:44,False,8,0,True,False,318,4,858,0,858,2023-02-21 08:03:57,684,-0.9465,negative,3 stars,0.5217814072966576

3748,133278727,"Do I recommend this game? If you like souls like games, then absolutely. If you’ve never played one I’ll still recommend it but keep some things in mind like making your decision to buy. It’s a souls like game so of course it’s incredibly difficult, but rewarding when you finally master combat and/or defeat an enemy. The graphics look great and the premise is solid. RPG style gameplay is so-so. You have no guidance, meaning there’s no quest markers. You run around the world finding dungeons and NPCs for quests and it’s not always clear what to do next. You don’t get a helping hand. This isn’t a negative per say, it just adds to the games challenge. A warning though, if you die, you drop your collected experience and must re-acquire it. If you die again before collecting it you lose it forever. It’s a great mechanic in my opinion, just a friendly warning. 

Combat is great most of the time but incredibly frustrating other times. Sometimes the controls are unresponsive or buggy. Enough so that if you’re an average skilled player you’ll lose your experience more to a bug than actually being bested by the games challenges. You’ll randomly stop blocking for a second, enough for a boss to get a clean hit in. Rolling/dodging is unresponsive sometimes. And because it’s a difficult game, a single mistake can mean defeat. I’d much rather lose to making the wrong decision, like dodging into an attack or mistiming a dodge. Mind you, I’m not referring to times when you get locked by animation, like healing or swinging your weapon. It’s when you’re standing still, and it won’t roll.  Doesn’t make the game unplayable and it doesn’t happen often, but it makes the game far more frustrating that it needs to be. Getting bested is one thing, losing all of your experience because of a bug is another. Again, it’s not terrible, just an advanced warning to approach combat cautiously.

Overall, I’ll recommend the game if you like a challenge. If you’re intrigued by the concept but are intimidated by the difficulty, you could try an easier souls like game like Jedi: Fallen order first. It’s pretty easy as far as souls style games go and doesn’t go into too much depth, but the combat is polished and rewarding.",2023-02-21 07:56:07,True,0,0,True,False,130,4,5092,1122,3887,2023-03-01 10:04:03,388,-0.982,negative,3 stars,0.46241662502288816

3762,133275633,"I bought this game a long time ago and just couldn't get into it. I played the first Souls game but just couldn't get into 2 or 3. I thought Elden Ring was similar. 

However, every time I was bored with other games, I'd load it up and mess around with it. I'd get frustrated because it took forever to walk everywhere (I stayed away from game guides). I'd get frustrated and stop playing. A couple of months and I'd fire it up and start all over with a new character. Then I was visited while resting and realized I had access to a horse. But, it was clunky to open the menu, click on the Torrent ring and go back to the game. Then I realized there was equipment slots for quick use. Awesome. I slowly began learning the mechanics of the game and learned it by getting slaughtered. I learned how to level up. I learned how to heal. I learned what so much of the game does. I even accidentally found myself in someone else's game and helped him defeat a boss. I didn't remember what I did so I had to try things again until it happened a second time. There's still things I haven't figured out, but that's okay. Like I haven't figured out how to get someone else to join me to defeat a boss. I've done them ny myself. I'm now working on Lyndell Royal Capital and just can get past a certain area. Not because of a boss or anything like that. I can't figure out where to go. I can finally kill things pretty quickly even bosses. I dual wield swords (both buffed to +8 and magic and Flame damage, wield the Golden Halbred +7 on Torrent and am happy to use a bow for tough distance fights.

So, what do I think of the game a year later? I love it. I love the fact I am having to learn how it works and what I have to do just to get the mechanics of it working like it should. Its a pleasure to have a game not tell me what to do for every aspect of the game. It's about a journey and it's been one hell of a journey.

3763,133275510,"Seems well optimized. It ran fine on hardware that it should run fine on.

There might as well not be music, there are vague slow tones, regardless of what's happening.
Combat is slow going, extremely clunky, and unsatisfying. 
The gameplay seems to be wandering around and either killing something easily, or dying.
Control scheme is reasonable, but inconsistent, and seemingly an afterthought for the PC market. 
Graphics are average, if not slightly above. The world has some kind of desaturated filter on it that makes everything seem dull. It's a blurry mess unless you turn off motion blur and depth of field. 
The art is good and consistent, which makes up for some of the visual shortcomings of the game.
The plot in 2 hrs of play is totally incoherent. There's a lot of exposition in cutscenes without any bearing. The few characters you talk to dialogue dump about what I can only assume matters later. I would consider the writing below average.
In 2 hrs of play, I leveled up, which increased some stats that didn't impact anything in a noticeable way. I got some armor that increased some stats which also seemingly had no impact. 
This game reminds me of old dreamcast games from the bargain bin..It'd be an absolute gem if it cost $5 and

3767,133274709,"Elden Ring was my introduction to the Souls series of games-- and I think it might also be my stopping point.

I had not played any Dark Souls games prior to this point, and the style of 3D combat was brand new to me at the outset. I was not foreign to difficult games, but most of the souls-like games I'd gotten good at by this point were 2D platformers and metroidvanias! Making the adjustment to camera controls was a learning curve and not being able to see everything at once tended to be a bit frustrating (at least at the start). 

That said, I knew the internet was an essential resource for the souls genre and a few beginners-guides later I was adapting to the game's language with relative ease. If this is your entry point, please, do yourself a favor and make a few google searches on easy class types and beginner's guides! You'll save yourself an immense amount of headache in the future.

Once I was able to adapt to the style of gameplay, the world really opened up for me. I was BLOWN AWAY by the scale of the game-world and it's (relative) depth and detail. I found myself repeatedly enamored, shocked, and awed by the amount of impressive locations! This game does something that I genuinely appreciate: it is not afraid for you to not see all of it's content. Games like those produced by Ubisoft and others are determined to scatter a myriad of location markers and it takes all of the fun out of exploration (especially when said locations are copy-paste activities).

But even a game world like Elden Ring's cannot avoid the curse of padding in some areas: particularly, the repeated cave dungeons and ruins started to become much less and less exciting. Running into them and trying to clear them out for items became a chore when I'd gotten through the brunt of the game's world but they're a necessity for progression due to the items they contain. 

That said, I think that it's much less atrocious in a game like Elden Ring and the world makes up for it in many ways; It's time I told you about my eclectic approach to discovery within this game's world.

When I set out from the start, I ended up receiving a single map for the start of the game. The remaining game world was covered in unmarked brown spotted with clouds. A tiny neuron (or demon, depending on how you look at it) ignited and told me that I now NEEDED the full map of the game. This became my primary desire in the game moving forward: fill the map. Before I wanted to explore anything thoroughly, I would have to get the whole map. For games like Breath of the Wild, I was able to do this exact strategy and had a great time doing so. 

For Elden Ring, however, this would prove a unique challenge. Many areas of the game require items, boss completion, and a good deal of exploration to find ways to access. I took to the challenge and immediately began pushing in all directions to see how far I could go with very little upgrades and levels. To spare you the details of my entire journey (spoilers) this was incredibly difficult, but I managed to pull it off. I made it to the final mapped area of the game and had completed the set!

From here, I began to explore the world more thoroughly and found it a great joy to go back to starting areas with my big boy items and absolutely cheese earlier challenges in the game. I made discoveries, I beat bosses, I played the game and had a lot of fun doing so: but it was around here that I discovered what I'd been enjoying most about the game and why that was about to change.

You see, I was getting almost all of my enjoyment out of exploration. Once I'd managed to do almost all of that (I am currently located in the endgame areas having explored almost all of the world prior but only haven beaten about half the major bosses) my enjoyment of the game was severely drying up. If I'm being honest, I am not a huge fan of the combat in this game.

Do NOT get me wrong, it is a superbly designed system which no doubt has been refined over the course of the Souls series, it provides a HUGE amount of strategic options (which I enjoyed making the most of as a Bleed-Build Warrior), and is accessible for a pretty wide range of skill levels, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Like I mentioned earlier, the 3D environment makes it difficult for me to get a full picture of what's going on sometimes. The way the world is set up, enemies and bosses either tend to be really easy or stupidly difficult. I hate the four century wind-ups and waiting periods on some bosses, and while there were highlights, I would often give up direct approaches and trying to be good at dodging (as a melee build) and would eventually resort to either over-leveling, cheesing with summons, or any alternative strategy that would get me PAST the boss-fight and onto the cool new areas to explore. 

To put it more succinctly, once there was little left to explore, the core gameplay of Elden Ring didn't really entice me. I think it's a fantastic game that will stick out in my mind for a long time to come, but it has given me the impression that this was the only game in the Souls series that's going to appeal to me. That said, I HIGHLY recommend anybody interested in this game give it a go, as my experience will likely not resemble yours. I recommend you take your time with it and if you get stuck, don't be afraid to look up some help!

+ not gonna lie, this game is very pretty. Each region has something unique.
+ you can try various build, even mage build is pretty good in ER (I hate mage build on DS because it sucks on bosses).
+ the sound, especially boss battle theme is really fkn good.
+ I like every main boss fight, except for malenia

CONS:
- ER has humongous map, too bad they recycle a lot of dungeon and reskin bosses
- fps locked to 60
- enemy has wall hack vision and can clip attack you through the wall
- malenia has artificial difficulty, I am not having fun even after beating it. I need to use ashes too for beating it, while other bosses aren't.
- no side quest tracking or such. It really confusing to follow each npc quest, where to go or what to do.
- sometimes it felt a bit boring, maybe just me, but the world feel empty, the only one that move beside you is the enemy, npc mostly just stand still waiting for you to interact,
- dragon enemies have inconsistent target locked, some dragon can lock to their leg, some don't. Why is that?

3800,133265831,"I don't like Souls games. I suck at Souls games. Bounce right off 'em. I didn't even like THIS game at first; it spits you into a hostile world, points you vaguely in a direction likely to get you killed and tells you to figure it out. That isn't immediately fun.

But then I started experiencing things I'd never associated with Souls before: A huge variety of weapons, with fighting styles and animations to match. Enormous freedom to build your character, including impressive magic systems (I'd always just associated Souls with fairly dry sword-and-shield combat). Exploration is always rewarding, with oodles of actually-useful, unique goodies to be found in the world's various nooks and crannies. A decent roster of summons to help with tough encounters, and many other tools to approach challenges. And while it does punish you in a way other games don't, you stop minding after a while and are never stuck in one spot, even at an important story boss. The art direction is superb, capturing both brightness and ominous dark. The game is so freeform that your way through it might be alien to another player, yet it feels rich and complete in a way that is rare in the era of microtransactions, battle passes etc. Elden Ring refreshingly has none of that.

Cons? The game needed a journal. Quests can break if you make the wrong bit of progress at the wrong time, and you'll frequently hit a roadblock because you haven't poked the right illusory wall in the right dungeon out of a hundred or so or didn't talk to that one guy in that backwater ruin enough times. This isn't a dealbreaker; most of the fun is emergent and I actually felt more involved by starting up a pen-and-paper journal to track stuff.
The lore is good, and creatively imparted, but it exists to serve the gameplay and build the immediate world, so don't go in expecting depth on the level of Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Horizon, etc. (Sorry Souls fans, I know this is a point of pride.)
The tone is also relentlessly depressing. The game world is pretty much post-apocalyptic, and outside a handful of NPCs the only people are maddened or otherwise hostile. Don't get attached to any of the characters you meet because there are almost no happy endings for any of them. I had to remind myself to come up for air occasionally to avoid it affecting my IRL mood.
Performance isn't perfect even a year post-launch, with some unusual frame drops here and there, but it still ran okay on my old laptop as well as my stronger desktop.
KBM controls are atrocious; you’ll want a controller.

None of this brings Elden Ring down. It's a deeply involving experience that has dominated two months of my life, and I don't regret it. It won't hold your and through any part of it I still don't know if these games are really my thing, but Elden Ring will stick with me for a long time for a lot of good reasons. I can think of several different builds and weapon classes I want to go back and try, and there are a couple of areas and major bosses I haven't even touched yet, never mind the other endings. Easy 9/10.

I love the world and the stories that exist therein. Have spent hours reading and speaking to any and all NPC's I can to engage with the story (both what has happened in the past and what is going on now) to the point that I actually care about the NPC's that exist in game.

It has been a long time since I have felt so engaged with a game. Being left to explore and learn by myself makes discovering any detail so rewarding. The game does give you small hints to stuff here and there and once you learn to read into these you start to feel a sense of excitement as to where it will lead you.

3903,133246556,"I've been playing Elden Ring for a while now, and so far, I'm thoroughly impressed. I'd give it a rating of 4.5 out of 5 based on my experience with the game. Although it's sometimes hard, it's still a lot of fun. I remember finding it especially challenging at the beginning, but as I play the game more and more, I find myself enjoying it more.

The story is excellent and immersive, and it's one of the things that makes Elden Ring a must-play. Although I haven't finished it yet, I'm enjoying the experience so far, and the story has been captivating. In my opinion, the story is a little long, but in a good way, as it allows for a more immersive and engaging experience.

3966,133228338,"After almost a year with this game, after 450hrs or so playing this game on and off, completing all the achievements, playing with multiple characters, with my friends, dabbling in pvp and invasions, and slight bit of modding.

I can proudly say it was worth the hype.

I'll assume people familiar and those who have played previous FromSoft titles have already played this so for those WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR with the souls series and are wondering if it is worth playing. It is. I played this with two friends who have never played a soulsborne game in their life and we thoroughly enjoyed it. There are a few caveats for a new player but I'll base this both on my personal experience and my friend's opinions on our journey. Here are some things to consider.

* I'll preface what you need to consider before buying the game with this. This is a long game. You will have to devote a lot of hours into this game. Mind you, not just at one sitting but it will be a while to finish a new game. It can go from 60~150hrs for a first playthrough depending on how much you want to explore and how good you are at the game. So consider that this isn't an over the weekend type of game and if you are fine with that, then let's move on.
* This is an action-rpg, you will have to learn the mechanics of the game and be somewhat adept to it. That goes for both understanding the role-playing aspects and the technical aspects of playing the game. Mashing 1 button with your starting gear can work for a while but without learning how to upgrade, using talisman's, boss mechanics, enemy and level layouts, you're gonna have a bad time. FromSoft's level design is impeccable and you'll slowly pick all of this up intuitively if you pay attention to what the game tells you.
* There is no difficulty slider, there is one difficulty and that's it. Your playthrough's difficulty will depend on your play-style and how much you want to delve into the numerous in-game mechanics of the game. There is nothing wrong with asking for help, looking for help, and searching for help. Whether it be youtube, the wiki, reddit, or online players, it's fine as long as you're enjoying.
* Co-op is super fun but is also annoying (sometimes). Traditional in-out multiplayer is not what Elden Ring offers, while I am familiar with Dark Souls co-op, invasions, and pvp, my friends were not. It takes about 3-5 sessions with friends before they'll get used to it and stop complaining. There are also invasions where the most fun and frustration was had. Pretending to be chairs and watching an invader get confused then corner themselves was fun but you'll also get the occasional god who can just destroy you as you run towards a boss. So, in conclusion, it's fun, convoluted, frustrating and the most unique multiplayer experience we had. 
* Have fun. This is a challenging game, but a lot of enjoyment can stem from that challenge. IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. Anyone can play it but that does not mean they will enjoy it. If you feel that you won't enjoy the game, that's fine, it doesn't mean you are a lesser gamer for it. You can revisit the thought of playing someday. However, if you have been craving for a different experience from your typical open-world, map marker, get into the top of the tower and unlock the map game, then this might be a refreshing and even life changing experience for you. The game's approuch to open-world deisgn is phenominal. Interconnected zones that are inhabited with such unique enemies and are leveled in a way that doesn't seem unfair (at least not at the first half of the game). These zones intuitively show you where to go and how to get into them. So enjoy the feeling of exploring the beatiful world created by Miyazaki and his team. And if you do choose to buy this game, welcome fellow Tarnished, into The Lands Between.


Serious Critique Time:

(Here I put some of the things I observed that can I found viable for discussion)

* Performance - during the first week, the performance was abbysmal and while it got better over time, I am still getting dips from certain areas. I'm sure this won't happen but implementing DLSS or FSR into the game may help some or even in their future games.
* 60 FPS cap - I know, it's for balancing with multiplayer. I personally got my ass whooped by a dude who kept stuttering while running and attacking. This is apparently caused by unlocking framerate. I'm unsure if it's the engine, netcode, or whatever reason but other multiplayer games have found a workaround for this so maybe in the next game, it would help if they could allow us to remove the 60fps cap since they have made a push for more multiplayer.
* Boss and enemy variety - I always found it a strange critique due to how many different enemy and boss designs are in the game. There is an absurd ammount of unique enemies and bosses in the game as compared to other open-world titles. Even the repeat enemies for the later half of the game are unique enough for me to not find it annoying, however, what I do find annoying is the ammount of the damage they do.
* End-game difficulty spike - I like the soul's challenge but by god does it suddenly kicks you in the balls then start spitting at you as you get up. Maybe I can say it wasn't that hard because my first time through the game I did not notice it but playing it again with friends suddenly made me realize how ridiculous the damage end-game areas can do to you, especially with multiplayer scaling. I don't know why I did not feel this in my first playthrough but with subsequent playthroughs it did seem unfair in a bad way. 

Overall, these are nitpicks that I found after multiple playthroughs. 

I played this game on release and finished it after a month. This game is an experience and will leave you amazed and overwhelmed with how wonderful and terrifying the world is. I just can't wait to see what's next for us tarnished.

4071,133206078,"Fifteen hours into Elden Ring, I defeated Godrick, the first of five Elden Lords. In the time between emerging into the Lands Between and striking him down, I'd discovered decrepit ruins, ventured into twisting caves, stumbled upon enemy encampments, and battled tooth and nail against challenging bosses. From Software's games have always made you feel small in many ways: They tell you that you're worthless--a plague-ridden rat or accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders. They ask you to navigate unflinching brutal worlds and pit you against enemies that systematically dismantle your ego. Elden Ring maintains the nail-biting combat and air of mystery that has distinguished From Software's Soulsborne games, but it's elevated to new heights by the studio's interpretation of what an open-world game can be. Having brought down Godrick, the breadth of the world--and the way in which From Software has applied its signature style to an open world--was on full display, reinforcing how insignificant I really was and driving home the magnitude of the task that still awaited me.

Standing on the edge of a cliffside in Liurnia of the Lakes, the area beyond Godrick's arena, I took in the world laid out in front of me: the enormous Erdtree casting brilliant golden beams of light onto the land that exists in its shadow; the sharp peaks of a distant mountain that look like claws tearing at the sky; a castle standing proudly amidst ruins; a forest blanketed in an ominous fog. It was all overwhelming, and none of the hardships I'd experienced in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice have come close to making me feel as small. At the same time, I was overcome with excitement for what the Lands Between had in store for me and all the seemingly insurmountable battles awaiting--and it did not disappoint.

Elden Ring is From Software's crowning achievement in world design--epic in scale and scope. But what makes it special isn't just how visually stunning it all is, or that its open-world is vast, rich in detail, and teeming with possibilities. Instead, it's how the studio has applied its own esoteric design principles to deliver an experience that feels fresh, elegant, and uniquely From Software. The game's core pillars are built on the same strong action and role-playing foundations as previous titles while offering more freedom to explore than ever before. Elden Ring is an open-world game entirely in a category of its own. That delicate orchestration of highs and lows and the build-up and release of tension that From Software has mastered, coupled with the thrill of freeform exploration and discovery, is an intoxicating cocktail of game design.

In guiding the player, Elden Ring employs the lightest of touches. The Lands Between is truly open and offers the player complete agency in exploration, whether on foot or horseback. The world is ruled by five Elden Lords, each in possession of a shard of the titular Elden Ring. As a lowly Tarnished, you aim to defeat these corrupt lords, take their shards, stand before the Erdtree, and become an Elden Lord in your own right. With the premise established through a quick cutscene, you are let loose and left to forge a path through the world as you see fit.

A key part of From Software's design ethos is to strip down to the essentials, and in Elden Ring that process strengthens exploration and discovery, the heart and soul of the experience. The studio's games typically give the player very little while asking a lot, and Elden Ring is the most obtuse and demanding of its games so far. This is largely because everything you've come to expect from modern open-world games is absent; for instance, there's no map until you find an item that reveals the topography of a region. Even then, the points of interest in that region aren't marked until you've been there and seen them. There is no minimap, just a compass to show the cardinal directions and any waypoints you've placed.

Characters, meanwhile, aren't desperate for your attention; as with previous games, the quests they task you with aren't noted down or tracked in any kind of log--it's up to you to do your due diligence. Areas you go to won't be gated depending on your level, and there's no clear indication on when you should go to key locations. The best you get is at the Sites of Grace, which function as rest points in the same way Bonfires, Lanterns, or Idols did in other titles. At each of these sites is a dim trail of golden light pointing in the general direction of… something. Perhaps it's the next milestone in your quest or maybe it's just another area that has a dungeon--the only way to find out is to make the journey.

The challenge for From Software lies in the friction between the studio's design hallmarks and the expected conventions of a genre filled with games that try to be all things to everyone. And although the execution is an unmitigated success, one thing's for sure: Elden Ring is not a smooth-edged, one-size-fits-all kind of experience that will accommodate everyone. Instead, it's unrelentingly opaque, relishes in the savagery of confronting players with unfavorable odds, and delights in watching the ensuing struggle. Elden Ring's gameplay will feel familiar to those with experience of previous From Software games. The tried-and-true formula of measured third-person combat against enemies that are swift to punish foolhardiness is both as thrilling and nerve-racking as ever. Whether you wield a sword and shield, swing something that's closer to a heap of raw iron, or stand back as a mage and launch spells to topple your foes, Elden Ring tests patience and skill with tricky enemy mobs and ferocious bosses.",2023-02-20 01:00:42,True,1,1,False,False,12,9,2950,0,2950,2022-12-16 22:44:37,964,0.9713,positive,4 stars,0.4724554643034935

4084,133201856,"worth trying on a sale, but has a significant amount of problems for the fifth entry in the lock 'n' roller + poison swamp series (6th if you count bloodborne). the gimmick this time around is the open world and the hybrid build diversity compared to the other games. consumables in this game are also significantly stronger than in the older souls games and summons are another accessibility or build tool available to players. the game suffers from strange combat feel problems and heavy content reuse, which I assume are caused from copypasting assets from sekiro and DS3. additionally, with a RTX 1070, i occasionally had microhitches during a handful of boss fights.

my playthrough was done exclusively with colossal swords, no summons in combat, limited consumables and limited magic use, so some of the complaints won't matter to those who are laser or summon enjoyers.

the combat:
- attacking on the horse feels very clunky and is excessively powerful. you spend a lot of time on the horse and it ends up contributing a lot to a massive amount of dead air while exploring since any packs of enemies end up becoming busywork instead of being a threat.
- the game is close to DS2 in terms of combat design, which is not a sin on its own. several fights are duos or trios, but enemies also will pace their attacks to not overwhelm the player which seems very strange given that most weapons have ways to deal with packs, unlike in DS2
- several bosses feel inappropriately boring, notably the dragon enemies that let you attack their legs for free until they die of old age.
- several enemies have unique attacks that can't be easily sightread and hit like trucks. of these attacks, some have very ambiguous or no telegraphs on followups (e.g. [spoiler]radagon's wave of gold looking identical to most of the decals that he applies is a strange encounter choice, you eventually learn that his wave of gold is exclusively a frontal cone so his huge slams will never detonate[/spoiler]) that you'll only figure out either by just beating them before you run out of hp or exhaust evasion options until you find one that works. if you don't level vigor sufficiently, these fights can be particularly frustrating. additionally, there are a handful of attacks that require the player to just run away (e.g. [spoiler]Commander Niall's P2 Frostbite AoE[/spoiler] and these feel very boring to play against as there's no counterplay other than ""don't be there"" and imo dramatically slows the game down.
- there is woefully insufficient camera settings, particularly when locked on. depth perception is a skill check depending on build. this is particularly annoying with my build as whiff punishing, stance breaking and knowing what attacks can interrupt bosses are vital to playing the game. bosses across the board have greater melee range than the player so it's very jarring when you commit and barely miss, even when the model looks like it connected. i ended up having to just fight most of my fights without the lockon and with the camera tilted up to make it clearer when it was safe to attack. additionally, some enemies can drag you with them during their command grabs which is extremely annoying if the camera moves during it.
- enemies don't scale to you meaning you can very easily overlevel an area if you go out of order, which punishes exploration - the only ways to mitigate this are to either spend your runes on everything but leveling or to intentionally let them rot.
- [spoiler]lake of rot[/spoiler] is an entire area dedicated to being a build check instead of a skill check. the only way to natively deal with that area is to AFK on platforms if you don't have the items or skills to reduce the burden that the area places on the player. if you have the health regeneration to deal with [spoiler]the scarlet rot without exploiting a lower level scarlet rot and then activating it[/spoiler] then you probably have also found the way to craft said items or obtain said skills, which are also missable. out of combat, debuffs that aren't fully built should decay much more rapidly.
- [spoiler]rykard[/spoiler] should have been left on the cutting room floor. literal R1 spam boss with occasional skill ask
- lethal fall damage past a 2 second drop is a strange include in a game that promotes exploration and punishes creative use of verticality in engagements, notably in mid-lategame areas. the only thing that killed me more than fall damage in the game was blind RL1 tree sentinel.

content reuse: the game suffers from heavy scope creep from the open world.
- mines, graves, catacombs and other dungeons feel very similar. each type of location shares the same aesthetics as the rest of their family.
- i fought the [spoiler]magma wyrm[/spoiler] 5 times and several bosses more than twice. even major bosses get partially reused, lmao.
- some strong overworld enemies are dungeon bosses (though it might be vice-versa, which is still questionable)
- the areas are so large that a lot of the locations within it are indistinct. imo, the world could have been compressed by 50% and maintained a much higher level of quality.
- all weapons that aren't enemy drops are only obtainable once per playthrough. in order to get every item in the game without trading, you must enter NG++ or trade/dupe with someone else.",2023-02-19 23:20:11,True,1,0,False,True,543,24,7812,0,7812,2023-02-18 01:25:57,917,-0.9995,negative,3 stars,0.4692026214166121

PROS
Dark Souls Game
Builds are solid
Leveling is Solid
Fights are Solid
Difficulty is Solid
Exploration and Beauty are Solid
Pure Builds are Solid
Music is Solid
Game Play Time is Solid
D.J Solid!

CONS
Crafting of items could use a little love.
Mobs cheese you with things YOU CANT DO... (hitting through walls)
Multiplayer should have just been the default out of the gate.
Mage build is stupid broken EARLY
Faith takes WAAAAYYYY too long to become damage relevant.
Some mobs don't stop swinging taking away the ability to backstab, not all mobs can be backstabbed or front stabbed like old souls games. 

AWFUL
PC control defaults...
Only can cycle through items in one direction so you need to loop THE ENTIRE item set if you miss your item.
Multiple Weapon Sets add weight, limiting creativity with no counter argument as to the detriment of doing so in the game. Let players carry any amount of weapons they like.
Controls are backwards for weapons as default.
Translations of some items are HORRIBLE... cat amulet... looking at you...
Fall damage should have an additional 20 ft added to fall if pony jumps to reset.
Mixed builds are almost ALWAYS irrelevant which sucks because they often try to ask you to go that route for builds. If they removed the -damage on weapons for mixed concepts, this might not have been so bad.
Had giant stone dragon... that is not intended to be climbed on... such a tease...
Had a giant stone tower, has nothing on it to do...
Had giant boss rooms with ZERO secrets in any of them making exploration a time waster... (lost 2 hours to this...)

4161,133184583,"Elden Ring is a fantastic and overall HUGE game that From Software has published last year.
The combat is fun (especially if you are using an INT build and you can just OHKO bosses with Comet Azur lol) and the overall open world of the game is simply gorgeous. 
I also have to give credit to the developers, because they did a really good job at optimizing the game, since it runs smoothly at 40-50 FPS on a 1050Ti (1080P Low/Mid settings), which is a lot for a GPU which came out many years ago.

The only minor inconvenience that I have found with this game is that some bosses are way too frustrating to handle for an average gamer (Malenia, for instance): it seems to me as if the developers have wanted to make this type of bosses overly complicated on purpose, making them very unbalanced in the process.

In conclusion, I recommend this game to everyone! Even if Souls-Like games are not your typical to-go game, it's still worth giving Elden Ring a shot. And if you find yourself stuck on a bossfight, you don't necessarily have to lose your mind and ""git gud"", you can just summon a bunch of friends and have fun!",2023-02-19 18:04:14,True,0,0,False,False,13,5,4495,0,4495,2022-12-30 00:33:46,207,0.975,positive,4 stars,0.5502919753392538

 Nothing major has really changed since before but there are some differences such as the following. Its open world so there is more flexibility to do other things if you get stuck on a boss. There is even better atmosphere and bigger scale than previous ones. You can teleport to any Lost Grace site (bonfire) at anytime from the beginning. You also get recharges of the health and magic potions as you progress through areas and kill enemies, this makes it possible to go for longer times between Grace sites.

4218,133164197,"TL;DR Overall 8/10. If you have not played any Souls-like titles before it's is a must-play. I will focus on the parts I didn't like in the review but there are a lot of good things as well.
Level design, graphics and music are outstanding, 11/10.
Boss fights: 3/10. Worst part of the game. Generally it's insanely unrealistic and stupid just for the sake of tricking a player. Bosses use their ultragigachad500kg hammers just like daggers, there is 0 sense of motion, inertia and weight. They can halt mid air, turn mid air and autoaim just to mess with your brain. If you have a melee weapon your tactics will be <roll> <roll> <roll> <hit> <roll> <roll> <roll><hit> almost for every past-mid-game boss, that's how they are designed to be `difficult`.
It makes the fights unsatisfactory.
Overall gameplay 6/10. Leveling up seems to be useless because every rat or naked hollow dude deals the same amount of damage as bosses no matter what armour you have. Perhaps the sewer rat should be the next Elden lord? 
Killing mobs provide no rewards. Looting is a joke, because 99% of loot is trash. Since all weapons are kinda balanced you can finish the game with a weapon you have found in the first 10 hours, there is no much point in finding a new one stats-wise.
Don't get me wrong, the game is good overall, especially if you have not played any DS title before, however for me the RPG and boss fights part was weak.",2023-02-19 11:58:04,True,0,0,True,False,194,10,4370,0,4307,2023-02-19 18:02:19,254,-0.9911,negative,3 stars,0.46487624446551007

4222,133163323,"The game's fine (and the whole saga) but definitely it's not for me (and if you're anything like me, probably you'll feel the same). Allow me to explain myself

Au contraire of many reviewers, I don't see Elden Ring as a 'masterpiece' nor a game superior in any way to an ultramodded version of Skyrim SE or AE. Sorry about that.

Nah, it's not about difficulty, you heathen bitch. I was able to overcome some initial bosses searching for tips here and there, it's about the gameplay itself: the entire world wants you dead, it's hostile, creepy, inhuman, inaccesible, hermetic and fucked up all around. It's exhausting and boring. Go there, be trashed aprox. 20-30 times by some weirdos before going forward. Repeat.

You wanna have some fun by overpowering your build? Let's do your research before playing: forums, videos, fan websites and the like. And I'm a sort of a'soft gamer' with a life and family, I don't want my time to be wasted before playing, I just wanna have some fun playing the damn game. 

Besides, I need a game to be plural, 'human', diverse, colorful; I need a game to tell me a story, providing me a challenge I really want to overcome while I'm enjoying the sights, the landscape, the NPCs.. In Elder Ring I'm just shitting in my pants all the time. Not funny, you know. 

Perhaps I'll give it a shot someday. For the time being, I'm gonna stick to my Witcher, my CP2077 and my ultramodded Skyrim SE. Enjoy this torture machiner...

4232,133161131,"It's too hard.  But quite possibly the best feeling responsive and fun mechanics of any game ive ever played.  So just running around and dueling mobs is a top 10 gaming experience.  But, If you dont consider yourself a hardcore gamer, with like 3+ months to invest into daily methodical grind, then dont expect to get far very soon.  Maybe dont even try,  I would honestly not recommend this game to your dad or your grandpa,  or your friends that are not very in keen with gaming.  You need to be a pretty good gamer to play this game. 
 They really actually DO need to tone down on the difficulty just a smidgeon for it to be perfectly balanced.  When people ask if its really that hard?  yes,  it is really that hard and harder than that when you actually jump in and see for yourself.  But it is also very satisfying.  You will play for a while, and think, oh this isnt that hard.  Until it IS that hard.  And you will understand the depth we speak about when reviewing this game.  The map is massive.  It is actually too big.  There is never a point during the game where you actually have a good feel for where you are or where youre going.  its just too much.  Even when I have grinded this game out to absolute completion,  the map still is too much for me to fully grasp at times.  I remember thinking multiple times that I must be near completion of the game,  and then realizing that I have only revealed maybe 10% of the game.  And then after unvealing even further like 10x deeper than my original, I would start to think that the end must be in sight very soon.  And yet, it wasnt.  The end is so far beyond anything you could perceive,  that you need to set aside all thoughts of ever finishing the game,  and just hunker down and enjoy the process.  Dont look for an end.  Dont try to play it like you are trying to win right now.  The game is just too long to think that way.  Its ebven more massivbe than mmo's I have mastered in the past.  I think there is a line in the sand when it comes to difficulty and progression.  This is a balancing act where too hard and its a chore that isnt fun to do, too easy and you are bored.  They nailed it, while at the same time, completely crossing way over that line and stressing the user out way beyond reason.  And this title really does cross into that threshhold of being just a little bit way too much for reasonable gamers especially if you have any other commitments to attend to.  I am a hardcore gamer, with titles to my name and a vast experience in pvp.  It starts out and you basically just die, and die, and die.  When You start to get a hang of it.  The difficulty ramps up x10. 
 And then the difficulty goes even further.  You play for another 3 days nonstop, and then the difficulty progresses even further to a point that you couldnt even imagine when first getting through the initial skill cap.  playing through this game reminds me, of like a journey through a difficult career.  Where it never gets easier, it only ever gets harder the further you go,  only, you become accustom to the increases of difficulty. 
 You get used to the pain.  You think the game will eventually even out and become fair as you level up and gain skill,  but it never does.  The ground you walk on, goes from being mountains and hills,  to being on fire and ticking away your health.  And it doesnt tick just a little bit of HP,  it chunks out large portions of health non stop.  And it isnt as simple as just use a potion.  As some items are non recurring.  Meaning you get a dead set # and you have to find these items.  To turning into poison that kills you in 5 seconds, but you have to survive in it and fight some of the most difficult bosses and mobs for 3 hours somehow.  The biomes continually get harder, in ways you wouldnt even expect.  It's like the devs have an incredible talent for making punishing biomes for you to experience.  If it ever gets too hot, maybe go back to that first biome where its all green bushes and grass.  Because if you arent at least walking in fire and getting rolled up on by something that has an entire set of boss mechanics, consider yourself lucky because it will not last for long.  What kept me going, is that the game is just so fun.  I would not play for 2 days,  and then I just NEEDED to play this game,  because its just so, damn, fun.  I couldnt stop.  Even when I beat the game,  I ended up doing 200 more boss run fights of just the same 1 boss I liked, just to figure out all the ways to perfect him so I could show off my skills in cooperative play.  Even then,  most boss fights, you can play 1000 times and still never get just perfect.  You will still take a hit, or die in some unforseeable way. this very epic and hard boss.    It only ever gets way harder to the point where you are finessing mobs with absolute skill and perfection,  and yet you still die, reguardless of your perfect skills and mechanics mastery.  The game is designed to be able to kill you even if you are playing perfectly.  And at times you cant even believe that the game could get that much harder,  but then it does, every step of the way,  the levels get even more treacherous and difficult, and yet somehow, you will figure out a way through it.  There are some fights you can get through 1 shot.  There are some fights you can be clever and find a walk around or cheese method, or exploit.  And then there are some fights where your currect charcter build demands that you just hunker down, and learn the fight absolutely perfectly, and then hope you get one lucky go.  There are boss mechanics in the game, that actually really do cheat and dont make sense.  You can play it perfectly and still get an unlucky go, and die. 
 You will have to just die and die and die and maybe on the 10th or 15th time youll get through it.  its a LOT of fun, but you need guts, and time, if you have the guts, go for it.  There will probably never be another experience like it ever again.  10/10.  Right now I probably would not play another game like this again, simply because its just too much most of the time,  unless they made a game where you could actually stand a chance on your own without looking up guides.  I had a constant 5 to 20 tabs open on my windows for guides for the vast amount of things this game has that you need to do or figure out.  Its, a lot.  It's literally actually too much.  I would suggest they make the map like half the size next time also.  And maybe not be such a complex maze even when you are standing in a grass and hill biome, its just too confusing and too easy to get lost.  Like all you have to do is take a couple steps forward and you are lost and confused.  look to the left, you are lost,  look right, you are lost.  That is one part they could improve in future designs.  Take out a LOT of the complex hills and shrubbery, ect.  Sometimes you just get tired of battling in a never ending maze, and especially when the maze is the size of the actual universe irl.  with all this said,  you cant play this game and not have fun.  it's all about the mechanics, skills, spells, and weapons.  they are just so good.",2023-02-19 10:52:26,True,0,0,True,False,14,5,30481,0,30481,2022-10-21 01:12:58,1360,0.992,positive,3 stars,0.4729825960738318

4235,133159234,"An absolute masterpiece.

When I first started playing it, I quit after a couple of hours. Being a ""Soulslike"" player since Demon Souls, the open world somehow didn't really spark my passion.

After talking to a friend I gave it another try with a more open minded approach and just explored the world in a more Skyrim like fashion. And what a great suprise this was.

The world is just amazing, on every corner there is another area to explore.

What I love the most about Elden Ring is that it is not ""forcing"" you to do a looooot of it's content. It's not the classic content rollercoaster ride. If you don't explore you will miss half (or even more) of the game and I think that is a real quality of an open world game.

4246,133155283,"As a long-time fan of the Demon's, Dark Souls and Bloodborne series, this is a huge leap backwards and I'm left with a myriad of negative feelings on this. From its half-baked open-world, poor technical performance and it's constant recycling of bosses. The world is a half-realised bore-fest with barely any NPCs to encounter (ones I do find are not memorable in the least), oh and the bosses. Jesus are they awful. The constant reuses of the same bosses, over and over. I'm only 30 hours in and I must've fought about 7 of those goddamn gargoyles, all with the same copy-pasted movesets. I also remember when other Fromsoft entries had bosses  that were tough but FAIR. The bosses in ER are absolutely relentless, giving absolutely no room for openings. It's a battle of attrition of I hit, they hit. And those one-hit kills. Good god. FromSoft really needs to distinguish between difficult and cheap. The stutters and FPS drops are another thing. The game looks beautiful, I would expect no less from From Software's art department, sure. But from a pure technical level, it looks nowhere near as pretty, let's say, as Red Dead Redemption 2. Yet here I am fighting with constant stutters, FPS drops, while trying to dodgeroll, which require frame-precision. This is inexcusable.

Not until it made game of the year did my I feel some interest in the title. Maybe I was missing something here.. Well let me tell you..it's true. The game is pretty damn hard, especially the bosses. I'm talking throw my controller harder after 15-30 deaths. BUT Wow everyone was right. It is soo satisfying when you finally kill one of those epic mobs. I'm talking about jump out of your chair, swear at the dead mob, and shout holy s*%^! It's that moving. The world is incredible looking, the combat is just thrilling, the exploration seems to be never ending, dungeons and caves have you on the edge of your seat, the customization of weapon and character are rich, and I just can't get enough. If your like me and heard all of the horror stories of dying a lot, they're right. You will die and die and die but each time your learning. You're adapting. Soon it all feels natural..and then you'll die again haha.  At first I hated seeing all the messages around and the ghosts of other players. Now, I stop and read most as there's some good information about secrets you'd probably never find. There's also some that try to trick you.. usually the 20 blood stains all around let you in on the disaster that awaits. When I'm in some dark deep cave system and I a short glimpse of the  ghost of a player it now calms me and let's me know I'm not alone in this adventure. It's really pretty cool.

4296,133144620,"Absolutely excellent. Everything I'd want from an open world souls game and more. Everywhere you go is exciting because there's always a good loot to be found in any cave. Even if I didn't use 96% of it, just knowing I had a new weapon, spell, or shield was great. I'd frequently find something I collected a long time ago was worth trying. If a cave has gear you don't care about, it probably has upgrade materials in it, so it's almost never a wasted trip.

The summonable creatures is a great addition. Even if you don't need their help, just throwing out some wolves or demi humans at a small town of hostiles is fun! 

The ash of war system might be my favorite addition to the souls formula. Being able to switch my weapons from heavy to bleed to sacred at a whim made me more incentivised to try different strategies compared to previous souls games. I mainly used Zweihander early game, but even after I switched to Ruins Greatsword/Guts Greatsword, I put sacred blade on Zwei for death birds and skeletons!

4306,133143166,"first time playing a fromsoftware game; really good first impression i enjoyed it thoroughly but i wouldn't recommend this if you're a casual player and don't have a lot of time to play a game. first off the map is HUGE, like i wouldn't be able to put in words on how big the map is, the best example i could give is the fact that when i first started playing and found my first map piece i thought ""damn this game is pretty big"" not taking into account the fact that the piece of the map i just got was the starter area and the only about 1/16th of the total game, maybe even less- so in short what im saying this is gonna be a pretty long review. 

next thing i want to talk about are the bosses, this game would absolutely not be complete with the countless challenging (yet annoying) bosses, but i really appreciate the fact that the developers didn't make it so if you encounter a boss that you can't beat you have to spend hours, days, or even weeks trying to so you can progress in the story, but in elden ring you can actually just leave that area, go to a different area that you can manage and spend a couple hours there to get something that can beat the boss. 

i'd say my two main complaints about this game are balancing, and how the sheer size of the game affects the story and all the things that you miss due to it.

the balancing: 
again as much as i love this game and how it lets you deal with not being able to beat a boss i feel like dying in two hits or even one hit makes it so when you do spend your attempts with said boss trying to actually predict the move-set just to accidentally dodge the wrong way or dodge half a second late you feel like you've just been cheated out of finally beating the boss because of some stupid glitch despite it just being part of the game. this is a really easy problem to fix as all you have to do is go back to a few bosses and adjust the damage output on them, or the amount of health they have. i remember (SPOILERS AHEAD) when i first encountered maliketh there was a draconic tree sentinel in front of his boss room, i spent nearly an hour trying to defeat them, only to enter the boss room and kill maliketh in a few minutes, this is the kind of shit i talk about when i say ""balancing issues"".

pacing and guidance:
now when i first started the game i remember accidentally roaming to the mid-game part of the map, to say the least i was vaporized the second i encountered an enemy, of course now its a walk in the park but back then it was like hell. the problem with this is the fact that the map is enormous and i spent hours just trying to get there since i didn't have torrent to travel, i didn't have torrent because the game didn't give me any hints on to where i should be going for it. talking to white mask varre and following the grace paths are the only decent guides you get at the start of the game and even if you figure that out those options barely work. for the rest of the game you're fated to just listen to the boring, bland dialogue of what to do or where to go not even knowing if you're supposed to listen to that advice due to you not understanding where to travel to next because of how incredibly vague the descriptions of your supposed path are made. i didn't even finish going to every map portion before i completed the entire game and was severely under-leveled for like half the main bosses because the game never gave me a clear path on what i should do next. the real only way you can experience this game at its fullest is looking up a basic guide on what order you should do things or asking a friend thats completed the game for instructions. i still barely understand the story and didn't even get a special ending to the game because i missed all the quest-lines for those endings

as much as this makes me seem like i despise the game it's still definitely a top 3 for me. i do still find my complaints valid but the experience i've had from this game is like no other, i never thought of getting it when it first came out but now that i have i don't regret it. again i wouldn't consider buying this game if you don't have a lot of free time because of how large it is but if you do decide to get it i'd first consult a friend that does have the game and ask them for guidance.

final rating: 9/10

4354,133133050,"Elden Ring leaves me conflicted, it is a good game, no doubt about it, definitely deserves GOTY. But the thing is, after playing the Dark Souls trilogy, it just doesn't hit the same. At the start of the game, it didn't really grab me and I didn't find it all that enticing. But once I reached the middle of the game, I got intrigued. Questlines like that of the volcano manor, were very well written and I found myself caring for a lot more NPC's in the game than in Dark Souls. Then the end, it was just underwhelming, after beating [spoiler] Malenia [/spoiler] and feeling one the greatest satisfactions I've felt, the end bosses were just a let down and the ending left me indifferent. 

[b]Furthermore:, some other smaller critiques I have:[/b]
- Dual Boss fights, my god why so many. Slapping two enemies that are practically the same in one boss fight just doesn't work.
- They really went all in on delayed attacks in this game my god, annoying!
- Either the one of the hardest FromSoft games, or the easiest depending on what you limit yourself to.
- Sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the intricacy of some areas like [spoiler]Stormveil Castle[/spoiler] or [spoiler]the capital[/spoiler]

[b]The good:[/b]
- Music 10/10
- Looks gorgeous
- A lot more NPC's that actually matter and have an interesting questline.
- Good sidequestlines!
- The DS3 weapon art done right.
- A lot more dynamics in your build through e.g MIxed Physicks, Rebirth and Ashes of War.
- UI is defintely better than previous games.
- The world is a lot more dynamic, espcially in dungeons were it sometimes felt like you were in liminal spaces.
- The use of verticality in cities or castles in this game is amazing, the realization that I could just jump on a roof and explore an entire different part or route, took my breath away.

Even though you can recognize some poor models and textures, you will overlook them. Because all the flashy, lovely places, well visually designed bosses will make you forget.
Audio design? Chills down the spine. After just turning the game on you are welcomed by the most epic track I have heard in a while. It is well-done soulsborne with some new techniques. Summons are an amazing addition to the game, spells and incantations are beautiful and impactful while not leaving the weapons behind.
There are also way more options with PVP cause they added an arena in one of the updates.
My biggest problem is the reuse of stuff. The world is big and pretty, but it got so huge, that it seems there was a problem with creating enough original mobs and bosses. It is common to fight bosses as normal mobs and vice versa. Another usual occurrence is fighting one boss multiple times (I killed that white fuck like 7 times in one playthrough).

4366,133131279,"I really enjoyed this game (PvE only), but there's a lot of hype and it isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a well-told and gripping story, characters you get attached to who develop through the game, and interesting quests, this IS NOT the game for that. If you're looking for a cool open world with beautiful scenery, minimal NPC interaction, a deep RPG system with lots of build flexibility, and super fun combat, this IS the game for that. 

You can adjust the difficulty by over/under leveling; I was probably a bit over-leveled most of the time because I explored a lot, so I thought it was hard, but not as hard as many other games I've played. There's enough to do that you can save the tough parts for when you're overpowered, or you could choose to never level up and go for a no-hit run.

The Bad: Most of the quests and NPCs are boring, and some of the quests need to be completed before others for no obvious reason. This leads to some items being easily missed. The story itself is kind of interesting, but it isn't presented in a compelling way, so it's hard to care about the world or the people in it. This is compounded by the fact that there aren't really any towns, townsfolk, etc. to grow attached to. Finally, while for the most part the boss fights are awesome, there are one or two that are glitchy and/or tedious.

The Good: The world is beautiful, and the locations are interesting and varied. The combat is wonderful, and the RPG systems are deep and flexible. There are lots of viable builds, weapons, and spells that can make gameplay feel very different. After the second main area, you can respec more or less freely. Exploring the overworld and various dungeons is fun and rewarding. Your mount can double jump and is a good boy.

Overall, I loved this game, and it's one of my all-time favorites now.

So I tried to fix it, and it the anti-cheat somehow denies even administrator privileges.

The anti-cheat then completely broke my terminal when I tried to use that to play. I can't even launch my terminal anymore. It is actively breaking other things on my computer.

4419,133120833,"Pretty decent for a victim simulator. There are several big big problems, though.

Foremost, there is absolutely no information in the game about any of the (side) missions - you have to rely on information got from NPCs only and this info they give you is severely lacking. It is literally impossible to do the missions without the help of our old pal internet, unless you are simply lucky with your actions in crucial situations or find out the next mission steps and locations by blind luck. The idea of the environment and NPCs telling you the story is refreshing and certainly a million times better way than Assassin's Creed-style IN YOUR FACE display of too much information, but in this game it is the other extreme - not getting enough basic information.

Secondly, the controls are simply utter shit. Console port in its worst possible meaning. Keyboard macros alleviate it a little, as does playing with a controller, but this should not be the default option for a PC game.

Thirdly, the bosses suddenly get unnecessarily tough compared to the previous gameplay.

Also, I do not understand the hype around the size of the map. It is big - yes, but not THAT big. You could drive your horse from one edge to another in a couple of minutes, the landscape permitting. What makes the feeling of the map bigger is the fact that it is artificially fractured by unpassable cliffs so that you have to go around via longer routes and hence the feeling of the map being bigger.

4456,133113502,"I don't really know what to say. This game is a mixed bag for me.

On the one hand, I don't like this game. It's too big. The side dungeons/caves/catacombs are all half-baked and don't add much to the game. I feel the game is simultaneously too easy AND too hard. It suffers from a lack of focus and I think doesn't do a good job at making travelling from point to point interesting. Again, I really think the game is far too big. Remove the side content entirely and focus on making more legacy dungeon content/ actually interesting open-world engagements, and it'd be much, much better in my eyes.

On the other hand...

God. This game changed my life. I don't know what it is, but I find myself appreciating life more, appreciating the things I have, and have gained a deeper understanding of what I even look for in life. A bit dramatic, sure? But I'm a very emotional person. I can't really describe my feelings without turning this review into a dissertation, so I'll keep it brief. Elden Ring showed me that things are beautiful in spite of all the ugly things around it. And it taught me to appreciate what I have, and not to force things to be the same just because they feel good.

I love playing this game with my friends. The issues I have still exist, and I think the way that co-op is handled does not fit the nature of an open-world game. I prefer the Seamless Co-Op mod for this reason. I feel as if Seamless is the way the game is meant to be played as far as co-op goes (even if the Rot mechanic is stupid as fuck. The game is hard enough already.)

I dunno. I guess I recommend it? It would feel disingenuous to not recommend it after the effect it's had on me. I guess I should just say: Temper your expectations going in. Don't buy into the hype. Don't focus too much on what other people have to say.

4460,133112369,"Tl;dr: 
Read a book or something. If you aren't a streamer or unemployed you wont have the time to play this game. Its size makes it a huge slog. Not a good introduction to the Souls Series and not a good continuation for returning players. If you enjoyed the bosses, you will be dissapointed, their moves are poorly telegraphed. If you enjoyed the multiplayer covenants, you will be dissapointed, covenants were removed, as were worthwhile multiplayer rewards. If you enjoyed the arena matchmaking from DS3's dlc you are in luck, it has made a return and since Elden Ring is relevant you will find arena matches. Go phone your parents or friends or go to a bar drinking, those will fullfill you more then elden ring will.

Rant start.
Elden Ring expands and streamlines systems from previous games, while showhorning in crafting and an open world. The weapon infusion mechanic combined with the new ashes of war, that allow customisation of a weapons moveset, are great. The invasion multiplayer experience has been neutered, there are no more covenants. The cooperative experience has been streamlined, with a single item ones summon sign now appears all over the game world at certain unlocked summoning pools for other players to find. The rewards for any type of multiplayer? Nonexistant. Multiplayer rewards consist of the equivalent of a humanity/ human effigy/ ember and something called a furlfinger remedy, an item to reveal summon signs. The furlfinger remedy can also be crafted by mashing together two of the same flower that can be picked from any roadside. Elden Ring has seperated the boosting aspect of a humanity/ human effigy/ ember from the multiplayer enabling aspect. This results in two severely devalued items. The default reward for multiplayer has as such not changed from previous games, but the percieved value is much lower. The removal of covenants and their unique twist in multiplayer means there are no longer any covenant specific rewards, that could at least act as a trophy. The new open world itself is bloated, to much space, to little substantial reward for exploration. Most exploration rewards are now crafting materials in unsubstantial amounts. Heavy expendable item usage now demands farming for materials from monsters, or prancing around the world picking flowers. There are traders, but not all crafting materials are buyable in unlimited amounts. Want to toss a kilo ton of tnt worth of bombs? Have a fun time farming materials. Want to do a bow only run? Have fun killing small animals for their bones to craft arrows until you find the right merchant. Then farm even more to upgrade those arrows with different effects. Want to use more special arrows? Hit or miss if they are craftable/ buyable/ must be farmed. 
The lock-on system is completely unusable. Not a large problem for melee builds, but anything using magic will quickly grow frustrated with the inability to properly focus a target in group fights and switch the lock-on target. Bosses are frantic and unpredictable. Their combat is intense, with every combo being able to chain into the next with little downtime. The boss ai has been 'improved' meaning some bosses can now read your inputs and toss a fireball into your face, if you go to heal. The combos themselves can also be incredibly dependant on your position with no clear stopping point, meaning that going for a swing from the wrong direction after the combo seemingly ended, can net the player an attack to the face. The percieved weight of a bosses attack can also vary wildly. Perhaps they start their combo with their weapon swinging so quickly that one is hardpressed to react on time, just to suddenly take an awkward pause mid-swing, catchin you off-guard. Elden Ring bosses can be described as experienced pvp players; they only use weapons with incredibly short startup animations, they are masters at input staggering and roll catching and they have deceptive attack ranges. But unlike another player they cannot be staggered in two hits. I can't remember where i heard this, but Elden Ring does indeed reward exploration instead of perceverance; exploring the bloated and empty game world eventually nets one enough levels and upgrade materials to overlevel any boss, allowing one to ignore the poorly telegraphed attacks of bosses  simply by the means of more healing resources and more damage. In previous games the bosses are consistent enough for the player to gather alot of experience with a bit of perceverance and use that perceverance to finally beat the boss. In Elden Ring the bosses have been 'polished' to such a degree, have recieved so much love in the form of varying movesets and combos, that i wished the animator in charge of telegraphing those attacks was forced to actually test them first. Being hit by the same high damage move over and over again, because the wind-up animation towards it has so little visual cues it might as well be a rythm game is not fun, its infuriating. Does this mean i am bad at the game? I would agree to that retort, if it weren't for the fact that every boss in this game has at least one such attack, an attack with a ridiculous pause mid swing. Every boss, with criminal consistency is guilty of this. Its either you overlevel the boss, or cheese him in some way, or you spend the rest of the year persevering through staggered animations that are meant to uproot any sense of movement coherency you might have learned over your whole life. The open world also quickly looses its novelty after you find another secret place only to be rewarded with a flower you could have just picked from the wayside in larger quantities. Towards the end i quickly rushed through every new area, because i knew that my time was better spent searching for anything worthwhile on the wiki and backtrack for it later. It was no longer a game, it was a chore i wanted to be more efficient to hopefully get to the good part. But there is no good part later. Perhaps the multiplayer could have been a major upside, but there are severe limits on playercount. The world is huge and the game is unable to fill it with either interesting secrets or wothwhile multiplayer.

Elden Ring is a fantastic game, maybe my least favorite in the souls franchise, but still an amazing game. 

For all the things I was excited about like the open world and crafting, I think that ended up taking away from some of the games charm, I never thought I would think something like this but I actually miss the somewhat linear setup of Dark Souls compared to the totally open Elden Ring - the open world becomes a little bit redundant when everything everywhere wants to just kill you (with one or two exceptions I think). 

For someone new to the franchise, I would definitely start with elden ring as it has the most quality of life improvements, the game is fun and polished.

4545,133083293,"This is the culmination of all the previous Souls titles, into one gigantic game that seems to have somehow fit the same amount of content and detail of previous titles into a game multiple times larger than them. there are hundreds of weapons, spells, armor sets, weapon arts and they all come together to offer more variety in builds and play styles than any other Fromsoft game. However, this is not without a few faults that this game has that cannot be overlooked. Because this game is gigantic, shortcuts had to be made when it comes to content like bosses and mini dungeons, so reused bosses and environments can be found. This can cause issues with the lore and immersion, as sometimes a boss can be found in an cave that doesn't make sense wielding a weapon it usually shouldn't. While previous titles had a couple re used bosses, such as dragonslayer armor, guardian ape, or the cleric beast, in Elden Ring, there are actually only a few bosses that are not re used. This can take away from the suspense of fighting some of the better bosses, such as Godfrey and Mohg, since you already had experience with another version before their real fight. The other flaw is the very strange variance in difficulty, especially in the late game. World enemies become harder than bosses, with gigantic health pools and often are in large groups, like the zamor warriors in the mountaintops or the banished knights in castle sol. This combined with the lack of meaningful rewards from these enemies can mean the best course will be simply running past them, which is not an ideal strategy in a game centered around combat. This is offset by the endgame boss guantlet, which is one of the best I've ever seen. All in all, while I highly, highly, highly recommend this game, I do not recommend it as your first fromsoft game. Dark Souls 3 is much more streamlined in its difficulty and is much more straightforward and easy to approach, as opposed to the sheer scale of Elden Ring which might scare some people away. If you  do want to push through and go into this game as your first, my best advice is to not give up and keep trying. If you're stuck at a boss or section, don't tunnel vision on that and instead go someplace else and check it out, find your own path that matches the difficulty experience you want, rather than what others may tell you to take.",2023-02-18 09:05:34,True,0,0,True,False,27,5,23361,6,23355,2023-03-06 04:55:41,424,0.3917,positive,4 stars,0.4801868379116058

4581,133074575,"I got this game when it first came out. I reached Stormveil (the first 'stronghold' area) while streaming to my friends (all of whom were super deep into the game already), and after getting lots of super in-depth tips from them, I rage quit after some bullshit (a friendly NPC steals your runes every time you die in his area, and I ended up going broke and losing all the souls I got from the 2 big previous bosses). After that, I uninstalled Elden Ring and didn't play it for a whole year. I thought about leaving a negative review for a while, because the experience I had first playing this game was dog shit, with too many secrets and too much emphasis on getting your time wasted fucking around and finding out.

A year later, I've dusted Elden Ring off to give it another try, except this time I played it my way. I didn't let anyone tell me what the ""objectively best starting class"" is, or take advice on what build to make, or which direction to go after I spawned. I just ran towards whichever horizon I wanted, killed what I met, ran away if I couldn't, looked up whatever guides I needed to to avoid wasting time with groundhog day-esque death-heavy puzzle segments. It was an entirely different experience, and said experience is the only way I can really recommend you play this game. 

If you're going to play Elden Ring, do it the way you want to, and try to limit the number of outside voices telling you how you should be playing. There's a huge temptation to, just like in Tarkov, let Reddit-dwellers (or your friends in VC) do the thinking for you and tell you what you should be using for the most DPS or whatever - don't do this. Don't let elitist slimes tell you that you have to fight every boss head on either, or that you can't use summons, or that magic is 'gay', or that you shouldn't play any starting class besides the Samurai. Use however many quest guides or maps you feel you need, and just experience the fucking game with the features it has, in any combination that you want. If you're someone that gets frustrated when a seemingly meaningless decision causes something disastrous to happen, make sure to look up each NPC you meet to see if they're someone who's going to help or hinder you.

4607,133069967,"Elden Ring is marketed as an Open-World RPG that doesn't focus on it's open nature, instead pretending to be Dark Souls 4 (with too much space). Enemies frequently do too much damage per hit, meaning that players should either go all-in on HP or not bother with the stat (focus on evading instead). This game still punishes casters (as DS3 did: no FP-regen, staggering stat sinks required, sacrifice healing for FP flasks, etc.) while getting rid of weapon durability (infinite melee). FromSoft is clearly too heavily invested in making a ""harder"" game (difficulty is always subjective) and failed to flesh out key details of this title. The questlines are convoluted and offer no guidance, even Majora's Mask (2000) included an in-game utility to track NPCs. The worst part for me was finding out after refund-eligibility expired that the game didn't live up to its hype and the first real boss can easily be more than 2 hours in.

4618,133067204,"This was my first From Software Souls game and I absolutely did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did. I have some gripes with it but overall this was one of the best RPGs I've ever played.

First, a few negatives; As my first Souls game I had no idea what I was doing for the first few hours of the game and I had to constantly rely on YouTube as my companion. The tutorial at the start of the game was pretty bare bones, I didn't even realise you could run until a few hours in.

The difficulty was extremely punishing at the start of the game. For returning players I imagine this isn't a problem as the mechanics transfer from previous games, but for me I had a hard time until a few YouTube videos taught me the basics. After you get over the initial hurdle you learn that the game rewards patience, it's all about learning the enemies attack patterns and punishing them when they show an opening.

Although the world itself is magnificent and the enemy variety and design were great, the game really sucks at telling a cohesive story. I had no idea what was going on and what my motivations were through a lot of the game. And my final complaint... no ultra wide support, that sucks on a game this big.

As negative as that all sounded, I still think this was one of the best games I've ever played. It's so satisfying learning the attack patterns of a boss and then trying again and again until you defeat them. The open world was huge and there was always something interesting to find. You'll constantly be sidetracked by branching pathways on your way to a destination.

The loot almost always felt rewarding, and even when I was deep into the game I was still finding new areas and mechanics. The ability to spec your character to whatever you preferred play style is great. The enemies were always interesting, some of the bosses had the coolest designs. The art and music were blended together perfectly.

I've completed the main story and I think I've been to every main area of the map but I'm sure there's still hours of content in the game for me should I choose to explore further. I'm glad I gave this game a chance. It won game of the year for a reason.",2023-02-18 02:23:39,True,1,0,True,False,311,23,4343,0,4343,2023-02-18 01:43:47,407,0.9879,positive,5 stars,0.5709704637527466

Buy the game you will enjoy it, non of the above should discourage you from trying it out for urself as it is as genre defining as zelda botw, death stranding or likes of it. If you are looking for a game that pushes boundaries of what games can be, then you wont be disapointed, as this is truly next gen experience in many ways.

4642,133062712,"Let me start by saying this: Yes this Game is really as good as everybody said it is.
but I will start with my negatives.
This world in some places feel too big for me. Many places you had to go long distances and some caves where just too big. Everything is a new area (we will come back to this later), even if you dont expect it to be.
The Difficitly made me avoid this game for ages. Or like, I avoided every souls game. Even tho you can make it yourself easy in this game (Mimic Tear Summon / Co-op Bosses and more) it is still more challanging then many other games.
and yeah the Map isnt really helping with navigating the Map.


the good part.
I MY GOD I LOVE THIS GAME
It felt like so many boxes where checked of, where other games just took the short toute.
So many different Enemys, bosses, Places, People EVERYTHING
The world is so insanly big (i said id come back on this) and it is filled to the top.
It looks amazing and it feels even better.
Often times I ran into a place with new and exiting enemys to fight and quests to do.

Often times when you ran into an encounter you could nor  (bc ur to bad lmao gg ez no re) or did not want to face you could just do something else, this was an amazing feeling.
My first roadblock was the firt major Boss, or at least i thought so, I had two friends with me that kinda guided me through the game, and everytime i hit a ""roudblock"" they told me it was optional.
There are places in this game entire dungeons optional. I tried to see everything and i saw maybe half

I really think you need help playing this game, either guides or friends tho.
Often times my friends gave me a direction and I headed there, picked up a major Item w/o even noticing and in the end they told me it was a major Item (dec. medal for example) I would never have found them on my own tbh.

This game earned every praise it gets.
I bought this game expecting an overrated but still great game, but no, it is not overrated and no, it is more then great.

4684,133055817,"I have never played any souls game before, so when the game released back in the february it was beyond my interest, despite the huge hype around it. When Elden Ring became the game of the year, tired of trivial, repetitive rpgs, i've decided to give it a try.

Despite the fact that from the beginning bosses were wiping the floor with me i had such an amazing time playing this game. The Lands Between look stunning and are filled with places and things just waiting to be discovered. After optional tutorial we're being tossed into vast world with one goal but without any explanations. The way this goal is achieved is up to us - players. Each player will experience this game in a different way, depending on which places were visited and what decisions were made. Lack of markers on the map additionally encourages to explore the world instead of boring us with copy- paste question marks filling the world map. The combat system, despite its simplicity, is very enjoyable. The vastness of the available arsenal means that everyone will find weapons or spells that suit their play style. Atmosphere of a dark fantasy world is wonderful, well, as much as it can be, because the fate of the characters and the story itself is filled to the brim with pure despair and tragedy. I found the lore in Elden Ring to be very intriguing and it completely absorbed me. I was hungry to know the story behind the royal family, the fate of the descendants of Marica and Radagon that were shrouded in mystery. And revealing these mysteries provided me the most fun i had with video games for past few years. The graphics may not be the most beautiful but it doesn't matter when the game world is designed in such a beautiful way.

With a clear conscience, I recommend Elden Ring to any player who likes open-world games, which throw one challenge after another to test our skills.

[b]The positives[/b]

An absolute masterpiece by fromsoft, there is no way to meme around it. This game builds upon everything Demon souls, DS 1 - 3 and other games have done and turns it up to 11. build variety, weapons, spells, incantations, all have been massively improved (so miracle builds are actually viable for once) to the point I cant think of any build in elden ring that ISNT viable.

all mainline bosses are amazing and most side bosses whilst reused a lot are also fun to fight. The story like other games is cryptic and the lore is hidden so using a wiki is recommended if you want to understand everything. 

NPCs are varied and amazing (ranni being my number 1 stunnagirl). Summons are varied and fun (black knife tiche, mimic tear, cleanrot knight, etc.)

[hr][/hr]

[b]Downsides[/b]

However, on the downside the reuse of bosses around the map is VERY noticeable you'll find the tree sentinel in your bed at night, the crucible knight will shower with you. Its not as bad as it seems given they're usually fun to fight but It puts off exploration a lot when you know the boss is going to be a random field enemy but with 2x the health and 3x the damage.

On top of this the difficulty spike going into late game areas is very noticeable and it gives you a lingering thought that leyndell was meant to be longer or harder.

Bosses can be extremely easy and a lot of them have various cheeses (looking at you draconic tree sentinel) that takes the fun out of fighting them if you use them. Not to mention bleed is very heavily overused with other status effects being left in the dust (they did madness, death blight and sleep dirty). 

There are currently 3 endings. Lord ending, frenzied flame, and the age of stars. the others are all reskins of the lord ending with various outcomes. 

Melina is never used to her full potential aside from turning into bbq meat near the end or popping up in a cryptic cutscene and I never found myself truly caring for her from start to finish, I truly think they should've done more to tug at our heart strings to make Melina's death feel much more impactful.

[hr][/hr] 

In conclusion the game is amazing even with its myriad of issues, and Id recommend anyone even souls newbies in giving it a shot. Just dont browse reddit and tell people you used spirit summons because the soultards will run to you screaming how you didnt complete the game properly because you didnt play as a lvl 1 wretch whilst undergoing a lobotomy.

Play as you wish to play, do whatever you want if it makes the game more fun and enjoyable for you go for it. 

Bleed build? hell yeah cut margit into swiss cheese
Comet azure spam? Hey I like DBZ too, annihilate them.
Unga Bunga strength build? enjoy staggering the moon and punish every enemy in the game.

4779,133025807,"I have never played a Dark Souls game before, but I have really enjoyed the time I have spent playing this version of a Souls game.

Bosses can be difficult, and after zero attempts at adapting my playstyle to each boss, I was eventually able to break through their defences.

Instrumental music is wonderful; I really enjoyed the strong beats in some of the boss's music, and the main theme was especially great.

It can be difficult to reach levels higher than 50, and some people use glitches to bypass this. However, you can eventually redistribute points and many bosses will give you plenty of rewards to compensate for the hard work.

I have not yet encountered the final boss, which I will not disclose, but so far the world exploration provides many bosses and enemies to fight when grinding for levels or acquiring various items of equipment such as shields so you will never lack in constructing the ideal loadout.

Overall, it's a great game, although there are some bugs that need to be fixed. I highly recommend Elden Ring for anyone looking to get into a Souls-like game with a great difficulty level for newcomers wanting to dip their toes into the franchise.

4883,132998691,"I like this game, but I can't recommend it based on the design and balance.

Quite simply put: You must dump most of your points into Vigor, or suffer getting oneshot by most enemies and bosses with their normal attacks.

Worst of all is the Crucible Knights. They are designed in the most frustrating way possible in that they are entirely built to counter any tactic a player can use against them. You can't backstab them, you can't status effect them. Their AI reacts to everything you do to prevent you from hurting them. They have way way too much health that you just have to whittle down for ages while they're capable of one-hitting you unless you dumped all your points into Vigor, which makes them only 2-3 hit you. Which isn't fun.

It's not that it's hard. I've 100%'d Sekiro, beating the Mortal Gauntlet and other challenges in it with little trouble. I'm planning on doing the same Charmless+Demon Bell at some point. Not to prove I'm ""gud."" Not because it's ""hard."" It's because it's compelling to do so. Because I have FUN with it. Because I ENJOY MYSELF doing it.

Elden Ring's ""to heck with your ""build"" just dump all your points into health or die"" design isn't enjoyable or fun or engaging for me. It's frustrating.

4888,132997359,"unfinished game. may be different on the consoles but for pc its basically an unfinished critter slasher game. story content is weak. no journal. no critter display upon selection (there's a blank blue icon top left with health bar but no info).  I did take several classes to approx lvl 50 to get a feel for how they were set up and had the most enjoyment from a wretch dex/int build or dex/ faith.  But at a certain point its just about running around for hours killing the same critters for coin to purchase your next level. managed to kill the first boss with a vagabond (knight)  I just put straight strength attribute into and it was very anti-climatic. Plus they have all these ghost images of other players in ""other worlds"" (which i''m sure is just them trying to reduce their server load), that is very annoying. I can't seem to turn it off but those images seem to be random and sometimes it gets in your view when battling groups of critters. oh and the targeting absolutely sux. you can have a target locked and just as you go to shoot it again the target lock breaks and moves to another critter not anywhere near you. I've had my character do a 360 in place trying to hit a new target lock on some critter 50 ft away. can not tell you how many times this has killed me. tried shutting it off in settings but it doesn't seem to make a difference. still needs work, but i'm sure now that this has been selected as game of the year that won't happen as the public has set their standards quite low. Also this isn't a traditional MMORPG in the sense that you'll be exploring with the other masses. basically you play on your own unless you want to join the PVP server, or you wish to have a few friends log in together with you, but i havn't tried that as it just does'nt ""feel"" right..visually its very attractive, and probably what carried it through the voting process, but in terms of playing an online MMORPG I'd spend your money somewhere else.
However..
It goes without saying the maps are wonderful. the castle have a ton of variety and theres loads of ""stuff"" for you obessive compusive folk..but sadlky for me it just wasn't what I was expecting. there has been several times i have stopped and wondered what I was supposed to do next (other than run over to that same mob and slash em again)...

4925,132989476,"At the end of the day this game is great. Truly. People may complain about the small things, but for AAA games these days, this game really challenges the lazy norm. 

I've played this game a lot. From trying to speed-run, doing ""challenge"" runs, randomizers, or even watching my mate playing as the ""Rump Shaker"", I've found this game has a lot of replay-ability and content that can be enjoyed. Hell, i'm trying to replicate my first run again with my latest character. I often pine on the 10 character limit.

Dungeons have garnered a lot of ire, with people complaining about the copy pasta-esque nature. I agree, they get grating, and all for a funny hat or talisman. But not all. Some of the cooler dungeons have a unique weapon like the ""Ringed Finger"" or ""Golden Epitaph."" But you don't need to explore, if you don't want to. The main 'Souls-type' areas are always a treat, with areas that are as densely designed. It lacks a sense of interconnections with shortcuts and secret paths of Dark Souls 1, but trumps the entire series in the area's individual design.

Combat is fresh and new, with the flashy weapon arts making a return from Dark Souls 3. This time, they can actually be used, for the most part. The weapon designs are new, fresh, and welcome. Dual wielding support is here, but classic sword and board can be just as fun, as shields have gotten a lot of love. Combat can feel a bit jank at times, with a tighter dodge window and many (MANY) AOE attacks, but once you understand the boss, truly, it is never quite unfair. All the main story bosses are a spectacle, and quite a good roster to add to the Soulsborne bosses.

Exploration is a big thing in the game. You can make most bosses a joke with the correct set up. Some may call you scummy, but the game is as hard as you make it. The only thing I can get angry at, is the amount of farming for some rare-er consumables. It's either something you can find under every rock, or a limited resource with a 4% drop rate. 

I never interact fully with the multiplayer. I did a short session, and it seemed functional enough. They incorporate some multiplayer aspects in certain boss-fights, but never in a way that is truly jarring. It's always interesting. I only wish Co-Op was fully fleshed out with no PvP, but it seems there are already mods for that.

Overall, it is a great game. Not for everyone, by a long shot. They tried to brand out to a casual audience a bit more, but it's still a souls game. If someone is telling you to buy this game, I would not buy it. You're probably going to get bored, and give up, a couple hours in. If you take this as a challenge to finish and beat the game, that's awesome. But most people I've suggested to play this game, have given up, got bored, or just couldn't. Only one person really stuck through, and that was with my direct encouragement.

The open world is incredible but isn't my speed and I get lost and bored after awhile. The world is incredible, just open world isn't what I'm looking for in a fromsoft game. 2. After playing this game I realized the reason I like bloodborne and sekiro so much is they have unique and addicting combat mechanics thataren't present in the souls series and elden ring.

I have never played a souls game before Elden Ring and now I want to play them all. This game was a long 2 month journey towards that 100% and it is now over. I know there is NG+ and PVP but nothing will ever come close to that first full play-through. I encourage you to step out of your gaming comfort zone and try Elden Ring, for it will be an experience like no other.

Thank You, to my friend GarlicBread for the recommendation.

My Elden Ring journey has come to a close (for now), are you willing to start yours?

its the newest dark souls game.

fighting same bosses in different forms multiple times instead of a new boss
story is flat and uninteresting
not enough weapons with unique weapon arts
no option to visually remove helmet
when i expect an epic scene, the movies always disappoint

4974,132974572,"As someone who has Dark Souls as their 2nd all time favorite franchise (Right behind The Elder Scrolls), I gotta say this one ain't great.

I don't actually wanna vote for not recommending the game, but it's the only option besides the ""thumbs up"" button.

Overall the game just feels hollow compared to it's predecessors. Pun only slightly intended.

The switch to open world seems to take away more than it adds. Seemingly just adding a longer travel time between areas that you would traverse in previous games.

Everything is even more obscure, and that's saying something for this series. Whereas the more ""metroid-vania"" structure of previous titles would make it easier to stumble across items and such, the open world aspect here basically makes having a wiki tab open in the background a necessity if you hope to actually find anything, or even go the right direction for story progress.

Actually, I can't help but picture the Souls formula used here as an old and tired Bilbo Baggins: ""I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread.""

Overall, if you've played the previous games, go ahead with this one. But maybe get it on sale instead of full price. Maybe around $30 max.

5011,132956085,"TLDR:
Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph.

GENRE:
Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' game

GAMEPLAY:
Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops.

'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.

Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.

GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:
Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient).

In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.

STORY:
The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)

STRENGTHS:
•Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.

•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.

•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)

•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.

•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough

•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.

•Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.

•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.

WEAKNESSES:
•PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens.

•Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.

•Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.

•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.

•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items

•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player.

•Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.

•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.

•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).

•'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power.

•Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.

NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):
9.9/10; easy recommend

Elden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it.

5015,132954418,"I’ll be honest… I almost let negativity bias affect my outlook on this game. I -really- had to sit on my experience for a bit as to not let my burning problems with the game affect my full outlook on Elden Ring. Do I recommend it? Yes, but with some caution. There are parts that I loved and parts that were absolutely asinine for me to get through. The biggest positives extend to Exploration, world design and the build variety. Exploring the world is an absolute treat. There’s so much to see in the lands between and you’re basically just… let loose with enough direction to not feel aimless. This allows you to experience the world in a way that is completely unique to you. It is so special to experience on a first playthrough. And even when I restarted the game to give it a second chance (I abandoned my first playthrough after getting frustrated) I still had a great time exploring the world all over again. Every structure you see is something you can travel through and explore and it’s super rewarding to see a massive mansion in the distance. Travel over to it and explore every nook and cranny. Of course Elden Ring didn’t invent this or anything, but it’s been refined really well in my opinion. The world design as a whole is mysterious and alluring. You want to know what lies around every corner and what the meaning of all the bizarre and fantastic things you see. The world building through Item descriptions and NPC dialog gives you insight into the world, enough to know what you’re doing. But still leaves you asking and guessing. I loved the amount of choices you are given to build your character in this one. You can do things like Tanky strength builds using Hammers and Greatswords or Quick and flashy Dex builds using Katanas and Twinblades. Combine that with the spells and incantations you get throughout the game and you get even more options. You can dedicate yourself to being a spellcaster or go hybrid with some melee options. Within the Spells and incantations there are subclasses of spells and weapons and talismans to go with them. This in tandem with the Weapon arts and ashes of war create a wonderful variety of options to pick from. The best part about all this customization is the fact that you’re able to change a lot of this stuff with general ease. So if you’re not having fun with your current build. You can try something else. The build variety is something that I’m excited to try again if I ever come back to this one. But ultimately this game has a -few- big problems with it. And my 2 biggest problems with this game are the bosses and the endgame content (Which I won’t spoil it but I will warn of it) The smaller bosses are constantly reused and overdone. They’re only really appealing to fight 1-2 times which would be fine if you only fought them sparingly. Unfortunately the minibosses you fight get reused a lot. And it gets really old, really quick. The only way they up the difficulty in reused minibosses on repeat encounters is to add another copy of the boss or add a different miniboss that doesn’t compliment the first one. Leading to lazy reuses of bosses that just serve to pad out playtime and end dungeons. They also try to spice up boss rematches by doing duo bosses but they never really work. Because the boss movesets just don’t work together in tandem because they weren't created to work together. Literally any time they tried to do a duo boss it just fails. It’s either uncoordinated and messy but functional. Or just straight up unfun and frustrating. Not to mention that certain Miniboss enemies, some of which are treated in the similar breaths to the larger encounters in the game. Can just be found in the wild just hanging around the world for no reason…  But then there’s the bigger bosses and it felt like Fromsoft went with a different approach when designing them. While I’m personally not huge on it I can see what they were going for. The bosses felt more like they were visual spectacles first and how much fun those -spectacles- end up actually being to fight come second. All the bosses look, sound, and act cool and they’re fun to fight when you’re watching somebody else do it. But when you’re experiencing some of these fights yourself the -spectacle- of them wear off real quick and the wow is quickly replaced by frustration… While the other souls games were “hard but fair” this game feels “frustrating but fair”. Sure I can dodge the mountains of bs being thrown my way but… trying to overcome these bosses feels frustrating. Sometimes I found myself wondering if some of these fights were tested to see if they were enjoyable to play instead of just “cool to look at”. What ended up happening was a minority of the fights were affecting my outlook on the larger picture. (IE: Malenia, Elden Beast, Fire Giant, Rykard) Because not all bosses are bad and unfun. Some are actually incredibly enjoyable and epic. But all of the bosses one way or another fell into one or more really annoying design pitfalls like attacks that are delayed unnaturally long, grab attacks that deal way too much damage and are way too punishing, super long combos which don’t give the player a chance to attack, and a camera that is zoomed in too close to see large enemies. Overall the bosses were the weakest part of the game and -really- hinders the replay value. Because I don’t want to redo some of these fights. Once was enough. Elden Ring’s endgame was easily the weakest part of it. Not only do the bosses get more frustrating than they were before. Not really pacing you with them and instead just, getting more unfair as you progress. The areas you explore get less open and more linear leading to a less rewarding experience. And the poor endgame (and one of the worst final bosses I’ve ever experienced in a video game) almost ruined my outlook of the game as a whole. Because it left a poor taste in my mouth walking away from the experience.   

But TLDR Do I recommend Elden Ring? If you love exploring and find bosses to be secondary in your enjoyment of a game. Then I can easily recommend this one. But if you’re like me and bosses are the highlights of action games like this. Elden Ring might leave you more frustrated than satisfied. And even with certain bosses (like the final one my god why did it have to incorporate every single problem with this game’s boss design) hurting my outlook when I was walking away from it. I still found Elden Ring to be a great game. Does it have flaws? Sure but those flaws didn’t ruin the game. Would I go back to it? Given some time (and maybe DLC) I could see myself coming back and maybe just skipping the parts I didn’t enjoy so much. But overall I could see myself recommending this one. 

But if you have any hangups about the difficulty… Maybe skip this one. The frustration you will experience might not be worth the positives.

5044,132947388,"[h1]Buying Elden Ring for the price that it's offered for in this day and age feels like daylight robbery. [/h1]Because I haven't played a single game in recent memory that comes even close to how much content there is just jam packed into Elden Ring, and not just filler content oh no no no. Tons of dungeons, a huge map that you can explore for hours upon hours and still find new things, hidden paths, huge underground areas and more !!!. Even the open world which most games offer as a ""feature"" is just miles ahead of anything else, the open world unlike many recent games doesn't feels lifeless and barren [strike](unless you're talking about C*elid, no no we don't talk about that)[/strike], it feels rich and full of life, the lush forests and filled with different animals and monsters alike, the mountain and plateau regions have their own biospheres and the grand cities like Leyndell and Elphael, Brace of the haligtree feels properly grand and lived in.
The combat is also one of the best parts, there's a ton of build diversity in the form of different weapons, stats, spells, incantations and ashes of war. The combat feels tight and fluid and heavy weapons and swords feels like they require a lot of strength and stamina to wield. 
Elden Ring is a game with insane replayability, you can play it for 100 hours and will probably come back to it for 100 more every month.

5070,132942777,"This being my first FromSoftware game, It was very difficults, but to my pleasant surprise, it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games. even after many nights of feeling like a victim, wanting to break my setup and wanting to cry.

The World
My first playthrought I spent running straight into fights and regretting it soon later after i lost all my runes. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was exciting.

Even if I had trouble with a boss or an area, I could just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on. There's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss.

Creature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.

The Gameplay
My first playthrough ended up being something like 120 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or attempting to get most items.

I also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasn't quite yet ready to take on.

The Multiplayer
I asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. It's also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon.

When you're in a boss arena, you can't be invaded, so if you're worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when you're fighting bosses.

Though honestly, the invading wasn't as scary as I'd expected, it was honestly kinda fun. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded.

Ending Thoughts
I loved the npc's, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly but others where extremly in detail and absolutly AMAZING.

Seeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I can't help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.

The only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zones. 

The optional boss in the many areas are one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.


Other than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.

Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if you're struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. I went with Dual wielding Katanas (My favourite build, a Moonvaile and rivers of blood)

Suffice to say, I'm super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I highly recommend the game!

PROS:
1. Beautiful world and environmental design.
2. Stunning soundtrack.
3. Enemy & bosses design are surprisingly vast, only a couple times did I saw same NPC template being reused.
4. Key bosses are top notch, with a few exceptions.
5. Open world is rich with exploration, it is never dull to venture into the unknown for the first time.
6. Plenty of weapons and spells (didn't used any spells during my playthrough though, but their visuals for example can somewhat be observed when the bossed or NPC invaders use them).
7. Some of the annoying game mechanics of previous FromSoftware games were finally dropped.

CONS:
1. Some of the annoying game mechanics of previous FromSoftware games are still in the game, namely: runbacks to bosses,  runes not spawning before the bosses wall of fog (which is especially shameful, since there is no equivalent to the homeward bone in the game, only the talisman which breaks instead of losing runes on death), platforming sections.
2. Few and far between but terrible boss design (from the gameplay perspective, the visuals and sound are always good) still happen: from the beginning of the game a player will be overwhelmed with how fast and hard the majority of the bosses hit compared to the previous titles where it's either strong but slow or vice versa, albeit this is still manageable by [spoiler]gitting gud u scrub[/spoiler]. 
The problem is revealed when you come across the boss which seems to not have any weak side to it at all, for me this first was [spoiler]Valiant Gargoyles- hits like a truck from a mile away, combos are surprisingly fast with a couple of nearly unavoidable attacks some of which one shot, very maneuverable, lots of HP, there is 2 of them and they use damaging poison[/spoiler]. Later on this boss and enemy design persists, which allows for dividing all entities in just 2 categories: nuisance and death coin toss, the later being able to one shot you no matter the build\armor.
Thus said some bosses just don't seem fair, namely I found this bosses to be a complete BS in no particular order:
[spoiler]1. Valiant Gargoyles.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]2. Godskin Duo of course.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]3. Double Crucible Knights in some hero's grave.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]4. Best cleric\Maliketh.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]5. Radagon + Elden Beast.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]6. Malenia.[/spoiler]
Which is a minuscule amount considering the sheer quantity of the bosses in the game, but still shameful that a couple of them is mandatory to story progression.",2023-02-15 15:48:27,True,0,0,True,False,184,9,11165,3591,7573,2023-03-03 13:07:36,428,-0.9845,negative,4 stars,0.43837658564249676

5191,132899551,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",2023-02-15 15:40:36,True,0,0,True,False,155,5,9509,0,9509,2023-02-10 19:00:40,528,-0.9988,negative,1 star,0.3603818168242772

Like every game, this has a few flaws mostly by repeat bosses and some balance issues 
manly going through the game your not given a real sense of direction where to go
this might sound like a good thing but it makes some boss fight feel impossible or way too easy.

problem 2 would be the invasion system
I do understand that Fromsoftware wants this philosophy where there is never a dull moment and u always need to be on your toes

But this is the most frustrating PVP system made and I hope it gets remade or rebalanced that enemies also can attack invaders or scaling down the amount of healing pots from invaders to 1 or 2 pots max.

All in all the world and story is amazing Fromsoftware have outdone themselves 9/10

5247,132878914,"World is very open; you get a convenient mount early to make the huge map feel appropriate. Most boss fights seem to allow you to run away if it's a lot more than you expected, which also prevents the loss/death/abandonment/rage quit spirals. There are plenty of areas to grind if you'd rather not get as good at the mechanics.

I wish the player character sketched in the map as you traversed it. I wish it didn't have an always online requiement. I would rather have a more casual entirely single player experience. The game is not perfect. But it is the most aesthetic game I've seen in a very long time; often it looks like the screenshot belongs in a museum. And of all the Dark Souls games, this does seem to be in the more forgiving half, which is great because I don't enjoy the more hardcore half.

Unlike Dark Souls the game has legit magic. It is still a hack and slash first, but the magic is well developed and can be used a lot, especiallly if you spec into it. With both healing and destruction spells, it covers the basis and there might be more interesting spells I haven't gotten to or been killed by a random invader with.

As an RPG and action adventure player, this game is great. Like I said, it's a bit hard and there's nothing to do but grind. I won't fault it since it's a design decision and I don't mind grinding. If you aren't skilled, don't want to die often, and don't like grinding, you should avoid this like the plague. If you are fine with just one of them, I'd buy it at least on-sale.

5263,132874564,"Honestly this game is incredibly overrated. Story is super vague and uninteresting, and combat is incredibly frustrating. It's just memorizing movesets and not making a mistake. I can see why this is ""the best soulsborne"" but that doesn't make it game of the year. What a waste of money. I'll keep rage-playing this just so no one can say I didn't give it a chance and I just need to git gud, but I swear I'll update when I've beat the game that it's still bad.

The super punishing boss fights are fun because they're bosses. I will give the game that. I like Monster Hunter, I like Remnant, I like bosses that are really hard. They're incredibly cheap and purposefully designed so, but they're right on the edge of punishing and too cheap, and they're bosses so fine. But for miniboss types or exploring the story path, the basic design of this game is really annoying. If you die when you get to a new enemy type, which you will, CONSTANTLY, then you have to wade through a bunch of mooks who can kill you in three shots by stunlocking you with a buddy, and congrats, now you've lost all the runes you had on your fucking corpse retrieval. Who does corpse retrievals still in 2022? So to get to the new enemy you have to play perfectly just to get another shot, but they are all designed with incredibly unpredictable movesets with halting, unnatural moves so you can't predict when to block or dodge. The whole game concept feels like that mario maker video where every time mario jumps an invisible hazard pops out as an F you. F you, you had no way of knowing this would happen, but now you do. So go back and if you successfully predict that move, awesome, he's got branching paths off the same stance that have equally unpredictable moves. I don't understand why people think dying a ton in order to learn a moveset is fun. And again, the moves are designed to be unpredictable. You can't learn your skills and get good at the game and get better, you have to learn each individual enemy type.

And it's not just the mechanics of combat that has bad cues, the rest of the game does too. The giant tree knight at the beginning is way too hard to fight. Ok, I understand that after a try or two, but the tutorial, the dude you talk to at the beginning, the tip screens, no one says ""hey, you need to be careful, don't try to kill everything."" There are no hints that the bigger something is, the more dangerous it is. There are no hints that if you get stuck, you should go screw around somewhere else and level up, then come back. ALL of that has to be learned through internet research (bad design) or banging your head against the wall so you're frustrated and now have a sour taste in your mouth after owning the game for a few hours. Even like exploring, the game tells you explicitly to follow the glowing paths, but if you do so you'll be incredibly underleveled. So not only do you need to explore the whole section of the map you uncover, you need to go off into gray unexplored sections as well. ALL of this is counter to standard game design and gamer instincts. That doesn't make the game original and inventive, it makes it bad because it doesn't tell you any of that. It's a choose your own adventure book that says ""make sure to read the story"" and doesn't mention you can skip around.

I legitimately don't understand how this game has mass appeal. For fans of the genre, sure, absolutely. But a game of the year should transcend genre. A truly amazing game is at least fun to play for a while even if you're not a fan of the genre.

5287,132870100,"It becomes a somewhat fun game once you invest time and start to understand the mechanics and how the world works. Like other FromSoftware games, the challenge of playing difficult bosses and beating them in and of itself is part of the rewarding experience. The scenery and some of the dungeons / locations can be stunning. My problem with this game is the open world aspect, the story lines, and the characters. The world is vast but empty. For the size of the world, NPCs are too few, most are simply silly and childish, and, like the bosses, they are unrelatable and there is no real depth to their story. What's more, your character, the overarching story line and the side quests utterly fail to captivate. Dungeons, mines, enemies, and boss fights are repeated over and over again in an attempt to populate the open world and weak story line. The endings are a total let down.

5290,132869604,"""I thrust the sword towards my final foe, teetering on the edge of my life. And as the rays of gold faded and perished, it was then that I knew my labor was finished. With only the blissful silence of the world as my company, I thought back to another, simpler time...

Once upon a time, I had awoken with just the clothes on my back, and a weathered blade in my hand. Swallowing my fear, I reached out towards the waking world, and the world struck me down; Oh it struck me down many a times! And yet, after each and every death, I arose to fight once more. No matter the ordeal,  no matter what unholy beast had devoured me, I would fight again and again in the name of that dream; that one day, I would stand beneath the Erdtree as Elden Lord. Thus, here I am.

I stood before my rightful throne, thinking back to all those that led me here...

Ceremoniously, I sheathed the sword of the warrior I couldn't save. It's sharp edge has served the Finger Hunter and I well. Then, I dusted off the armor of my fallen friend, its protection has kept me alive more times than I could count. Day by day, I hope that the half-wolf is at peace. After that, I sat upon my rightful throne. Unconsciously, I twirled holy fire in my hand. Miriel's teachings were vast, inspiring, wonderful, as is Miriel. I should pay him a visit...

Carefully, I reached onto my belt, grasping the winged sword insignia tightly; a last gift from the girl of scarlet hair. Perhaps the most important person I've met other than my faithful maiden; The girl who's sword was unbreakable, her will, even more so. The girl who fought side by side with me from the beginning, the girl who's hair shall stay scarlet forever —is someone I will never forget.

In the beginning, I walked the ruined world as a tarnished. Now, I stand as the Elden Lord... 

and one day, you can too.""",2023-02-15 02:53:25,True,0,0,True,False,46,2,12783,0,12783,2023-01-28 02:02:46,345,0.8685,positive,5 stars,0.5927180647850037

I played it for a bit last spring and ended up grinding *a lot* in order to get good enough to beat the bosses, but continuously failed because I didn't know about iframes, and didn't know about the ability to summon.

Positives: The world is huge and fully explorable.  If you like the explorability of skyrim, you'll probably love this, for similar reasons.  There are lots of different types of monsters and they're weird and alien and eerie and often wonderful  The lore is deep and nearly impenetrable.  There are lots of fun uses of language that I hadn't encountered before.  

Negatives: You must use external sources to understand just about everything.  The in-game explanations of mechanics is basically non-existent past the tutorial.  Also, from what I gather, the plot is crazy convoluted, and I am concerned that it will be too complex to gain any satisfaction from the ending.

5339,132858894,"Go check out Malcolm Reynolds on Youtube first of all, cool guy.

So this game has a problem, a big one. The devs are trying to stomp out all cheating, so the coding community has double downed and created multiple ways to bypass EAC WHILE ONLINE. Welcome to the old DS3 days of getting crashed, and softbanned without knowing your inventory was edited. The issue isn't incredibly prevalent right now, but as a former CE coder for DS3 I can tell you quite easily where we are headed.

Once the game drops in price, it'll be overran. A lot of people now are just using whatever edits they can get away with, and some people are even buying multiple copies to ban evade. So right now it's not a super invasive issue, but within a year it will be. The price drop will hit, hackers will buy up multiple copies, and the harassment will begin. Do you remember frame DCed? Do you remember the crashes so bad that you had to restart your PC? Do you remember being teleported into a room, with no way out, and all your bonfires disabled? We are heading that direction. It's inevitable no matter what they do with the AC, but now the devs are trying to ban anyone, and everyone who uses any sort of edit of any kind. 

I don't see harm in people editing their level for PvP, and I don't see issues with people creating new builds via CE editing (changing bullet values so you can use boss spells, or spells that are hidden within the code) A lot of this is really cool, and we even made a community in DS3 to prevent blackhats from ruining our fightclubs. We'd have an omega hacker defending the fight club, crashing anyone he detected as a blackhat. Now? Nobody wants to defend anymore, and you can still be force invaded at any time. There's no way to defend yourself unless you want to catch a ban. I personally ran countercheats to crash hackers if they messed with me. Now? Defending myself will net me a ban.

Now let's talk about the game.

This is by far the hardest ""souls"" game to be released, the threads complaining about everything after you reach the point of no return, are numerous. The ultra super special boss, even popular streamers are saying shes boring, and the only way to win is to remember her combos perfectly. No variation to that fight, if you try to get some space, rush combo, if you try to position, rush combo. It's just playing 100% defense and hoping you can land occasional hits. If she manages to hit you, she heals. So that's fun.

Outside the last 4 or 5 bosses, the game is great. Once you hit that endgame it's like the Berlin wall, won't come down for some time. The majority of players I talk to are gated after or right before Fire Giant. The game RAMPS incredibly hard during that period, where a fully kitted, max level, max stat character can still be 2 shotted. How do you think those fights go for anyone around 140? The recommended level. It doesn't, seen too many people whine about difficulty, and quit.

I personally agree, the late game ramps just a little too hard, and relies on mechanics that are just not fun. I'd rather play bloodborne, or DS3 any day. Most people who disagree with my opinion, also follow with ""GIT GUD LOL BAD SCRUB"" Yet, I'm not seeing as many as I did during DS3, maybe it's because that game was actually fair? Only 33% of players have beat that super hard boss that I was talking about early on, and 19% of players have even beat the game. Some people say that the last two bosses of the story, are harder than anything else. I personally think that the secret boss is the hardest boss I've ever beat legit. This is coming from someone who soloed the bloodborne DLC with no deaths from the bosses. Soloed all the souls games except this one, there must be something wrong here right?

Food for thought. Not really worth 60$ for a game that you will probably quit near endgame.",2023-02-14 22:48:08,False,0,0,True,False,432,187,1836,0,1836,2023-02-09 00:27:20,711,-0.9883,negative,2 stars,0.3985995948314667

5358,132851072,"A fantastic and epic adventure that sets the standards for what a single player game should be. It has a deep lore, great fighting mechanics, amazing world building, artistic vistas, and possibilities for multiple play styles. It rewards curiosity and skill. It lives up to the high expectations of a souls game. Highly recommended.

However, I am not sure if it is my favorite souls game. Although, the open world helps temper the difficulty level of the game making it more accessible to players new to the souls games, that also introduces a lot of redundancies into what can otherwise be a shorter and more classier experience. In past souls games (specially DS1), bosses have been more than just about rolling and hitting.

I could kill anything the game threw at me, some easier than others. I have yet to be stuck on a boss for more than a few hours.

The biggest pro of the game is the exploration, it is old school open world, and we definitely need more of those around these days. 

The biggest con is the dual boss fights, they are horribly designed and I almost quit when I had to fight 2 burial dogs, The worst is that you have a dual boss that's part of the main story and it is one of the hardest dual bosses too, I might quit when I get to it, or I'll cheese it, still recommend the game though, it's definitely worth",2023-02-14 20:30:05,True,0,0,False,False,144,86,7996,2329,4501,2023-02-27 14:48:54,169,-0.9412,negative,4 stars,0.4123234152793884

Where everything literally wants to kill you. With cool discoveries to be found in unexpected places. The games ridiculously hard too. I was having trouble at the beginning of the game trying to kill the feeble soldiers of all things. 

If you do not have much gaming experience(like me) I  wouldn't recommend this game. For this is not a game that holds yer hand like all those MMOs. Nor is it easy to slay any of the behemoths and foul monsters that are littered across the land. You'll most likely end up catching the contagious disease of rage which may lead to unwanted side effects.

5365,132849800,"I'm not typically a fan of these types of games. I could never get into Dark Souls so I never tried to get into any of the other FromSoft games until I heard everybody talking about how good Elden Ring was at work. I was still skeptical so I waited until the game went on sale before trying it out.

I wish I had tried it sooner.

The addition of the open world and the ability to skip hard encounters and come back later has really improved the playability of this game. The world is phenomenally crafted and is much more enjoyable to traverse than the likes of Assassin's Creed Valhalla & Hogwarts Legacy (two games I've also played recently). The world is beautiful and there always seems to be a surprise everywhere you look. I've been wanting to replay Skyrim for awhile, but haven't because I want to enjoy a game that I have yet to play. Elden Ring scratched that Skyrim itch.

Elden Ring is still a hard FromSoft game, but it is much less forgiving than most of their releases. Checkpoints are more numerous and closer together. A lot of difficult encounters are optional. The tough encounters will make you feel very empowered when you finally overcome them.

5405,132835811,"In short, I feel like FromSoftware took all the aspects we liked from previous Soulsborne games and crafted this beautiful open-world RPG with it. It is a wonderful introduction to the genre of ""souls-like.""

[b]Things I Liked:[/b]
- The ""play at your own pace"" world structure. You aren't limited to a linear progression, so if you want to get stronger or explore other areas, you are able to do so. You don't have to fight main bosses with just what you gather in the starting area. In fact, if you don't care about 100%ing the game, you can completely skip some areas you don't like (looking at you, [spoiler]Caelid[/spoiler].)
- More Grace Sites (bonfires)! I know in previous Soulsborne games, part of the challenge of the game was the fact that bonfires were spread out so much. But in Elden Ring, I don't think having so many Graces significantly lowers this challenge. Considering that Elden Ring is open-world, the amount of Grace Sites feels appropriate, and I think less would actually hurt the game.
- The many different endings. Each ending [spoiler]significantly alters the world of Elden Ring[/spoiler] and there is no obvious ""good"" or ""bad"" ending. So this aspect combined with the many different classes/builds you can do makes every playthrough of Elden Ring unique and fun.
- The spirit summons (also in the section below). Spirit summons help you feel not so alone when you're fighting bosses and can be really helpful in splitting agro. I especially thought [spoiler]the Mimic Tear[/spoiler] was a really cool experience and idea.

[b]Things I Didn't Like:[/b]
- The spirit summon reliance. Spirit summons are a really, REALLY useful tool against bosses. To the point that some bosses can be trivialized with them. You can fight bosses without them, but you almost feel like you have to use them, since it seems like some of the bosses are built with the usage of spirit summons in mind. What I'm trying to say is: I think the bosses would be more challenging and satisfying to kill if spirit summons weren't so OP.
- The multi-boss fights. Specifically, [spoiler]the Godskin Duo[/spoiler]. Nasu put it well: in previous Soulsborne games, when you would encounter a multi-boss fight, one would usually take a more ""passive"" stance when the other is in a more ""active"" stance. This was a good balance. But in Elden Ring, they are usually both in a hyper-aggressive active stance which can definitely be frustrating to deal with.
- You can't revisit [spoiler]Leyndell Royal Capital[/spoiler] after you [spoiler]defeat Maliketh[/spoiler]. This makes sense lore-wise, but it is frustrating if you're playing Elden Ring blind or simply didn't realize you didn't explore that area enough until it's too late. A fix perhaps would be to have a feature in the Roundtable Hold where you can toggle which version of [spoiler]Leyndell[/spoiler] you want access to after you beat the game.

Overall, I can see why Elden Ring gained so much popularity, including from those where this was their first souls-like game. Its Game of the Year title was well-deserved.

Yea, I enjoyed it more than DaS3 thats for sure. For one experimenting with weapon arts on different weapons is fun finding what suits you better.
Cons: well the copy+paste bosses do get repetitive, especially those snake trees with their frantic movements and weird hit boxes that made me question ''how did my 2meter sword not hit it?'' And the final boss was a complete hemorrhoid in my ass, not cause its hard, not cause of skill issue, but cause it runs away constantly while throwing drivebys with holy projectiles (hope you got that holy protection talisman, another free tip: get something that has black flame, me being an ungabunga melee build had to use Godslayer or blackflame tornado). Yea it took me less tries than Malenia, but there it was a skill issue or greediness on my part, here it was more like praying to RNGesus for it to stand still for me to whack it, dunno maybe mages or priests have an easier time with it, but my monkey brain didnt have a fun time with it.",2023-02-14 13:47:26,True,0,0,True,False,89,23,7506,1533,5973,2023-03-07 01:32:24,237,0.9805,positive,3 stars,0.42659013470013935

Right from the start, when you reach Limgrave the game doesn't hold you back like the other souls games where you have to complete an area in order to access the next region, as it gives you freedom to go anywhere you like which I really loved about this game. Even games like Witcher, Far Cry has the same problem which I totally despise where if you go to a new region, you immediately get f*cked as there is a level system in the game.
 
After playing for 117 hrs, I'm still finding soo many hidden caves, bosses, and new areas which I wouldn't have enjoyed if the game gave me side quests right from the get go.

This game has a lot to explore and the devs have added and changed certain things make it kind of look like a non-souls game like the ""Jump"" button which gives accessibility to the players, different weapon arts for different weapons which you can swap, get assistance from ashes which will aid you in boss battle and the biggest addition of all, a horse which would help you tremendously to traverse through the whole map.

5482,132812383,"This game is more or less like every other FromSoft game, for better and worse. There's really no reinventing of the wheel here aside from the open world. In some cases this works against and in favor of the player experience.

The open world aspect is pretty fun, there's a lot of really picturesque things to see and screenshot worthy areas that are incredible first time around, but that's kind of where the benefits end. If that's a huge deal to you, you'll love it. For everything else, it's kind of a step in the opposite direction. Quests follow the standard FromSoft 'we won't tell you shit about what you're supposed to do, who to find, who to kill, figure it out on your own.' This approach is serviceable in their other games because of their size but is terrible in a game this large. It might give players an excuse for multiple NG+, but when you spent upwards of 150 hours and there are quests you still need to look up online because you have no idea what random shit ends them or where to go, and this is every quest, it becomes a problem. It's more of a problem when, in FromSoft fashion, much of the lore is hidden behind items, subtle interactions that may or may not have branching paths (again, some of which end quests entirely). To me, this is just not enjoyable. I don't mind having to find items to learn the lore, but the content is not easily accessible and becomes an irritation. The open world also makes this game the easiest to over level on, either accidentally or on purpose. I ended up clearing Caelid after Stormveil Castle because of the lack of direction and trivialized much of the game after and I feel like I lost out on a lot of first time experiences because of it when I went back to lower level areas.

The PvP is also in a god awful state. The balancing is more or less OK after so many iterations of patches, but the lag is terrible. People walking through your spells and attacks, frames in animations being skipped, a hit registering and dealing no damage (I found this one out using Gargoyle's Blackblade), or being plus frames in a situation and the lag makes you lose out -- a colossal weapon beating out a rapier in speed for instance. 

The camera and lock-on are also some of the biggest messes I've seen since Red Ninja, the platforming is still mostly unusable and should be scrapped entirely.

It's not all bad though. Despite some bosses having broken hurt boxes, they're mostly well designed and challenging. The characters themselves, once you're actually able to access their lore, have some of the most compelling stories in any FromSoft game. This is easily FromSoft at their best if we ignore Sekiro, which was a masterpiece, and makes it hard to really look at any earlier Souls games without wondering why you wouldn't just play this instead. You should probably get it if these types of games interest you, but there are some pretty big glaring issues and some subjective things you might not enjoy. I still can't get over the experience systems in these games, but I accept it when I play them.",2023-02-14 05:08:10,True,0,1,True,False,138,2,11045,2,9544,2023-02-28 18:39:29,553,-0.9812,negative,3 stars,0.4746723302773067

Everybody knows this game is good, you don't need me to tell you. If you're afraid it's too difficult for you, there are strategies to make the game easier. If you have the money and the time to spend on this game, it will be worth them both, trust me.

My experience:
That said, as a souls fan, I didn't feel like this game really attended my expectations (which to be fair where problaby very high). It's weird to describe: part of me loved this game, but another part of me was also expecting something else, or for things to be different about it, I don't know. 
Probably the biggest part of the insatisfaction I have with this game is the ""level-scaling system"" (for lack of a better term. It's actually the interaction of the XP system with the open word system): because it's such an open game, you end up missing entire areas when you're at their intended level, and when you actually find them, those areas are way too easy for you. This happened so much so that I had this doubt of having my level way too low/high throughout basically the whole game. Not only is this the first time I feel that in a souls game, it is also really annoying, because you always have that feeling in your head: ""Damn, this boss was so hard, was my level way too low for him?"" or, even worse: ""This boss was so easy! I guess my level is way too high for this section of the game"" (the latter happened to me more often, which is a shame). This happens mostly with the optional bosses, but having this constant thought in my head really detracted from my experience, I believe.
Overall I think the openness of the map as opposed to previous titles was a double-edge sword: It provided incredible moments of wanderlust and exploration, but also made me not enjoy the main parts of the game as much.",2023-02-14 05:00:27,True,0,0,True,False,176,4,7196,0,7196,2022-12-16 17:56:43,333,0.5942,positive,4 stars,0.4735371470451355

5489,132811418,"Having had the opportunity to engage with FromSoftware's latest magnum opus, Elden Ring, it can be unequivocally stated that this game is a tour de force of the gaming industry, and truly the finest example of the medium to date. With an unparalleled sense of immersion and gameplay mechanics that are both innovative and refined, Elden Ring has exceeded all expectations and delivered an experience that is simply unparalleled.

The game's world-building is a triumph of imagination and artistic vision. The open-world design, with its countless vistas and captivating architecture, instills a sense of awe and wonder in the player, drawing them in and encouraging them to explore every inch of this vast landscape. The lore of Elden Ring is equally compelling, with a rich and complex history that is both tantalizing and elusive, revealing itself in pieces over time as the player delves deeper into the game.

The combat system in Elden Ring is a masterpiece of design, combining the best aspects of FromSoftware's previous titles with new mechanics that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. The player has access to a wide range of weapons, spells, and abilities, each with its own unique properties that can be combined and modified to suit the player's playstyle. The game's bosses are equally impressive, with each one providing a unique and memorable challenge that requires the player to adapt and overcome.

Elden Ring's graphics and sound design are a feast for the senses, with stunning visuals that are brought to life by a haunting and evocative soundtrack. The attention to detail in the game's environments, characters, and enemies is truly staggering, with every aspect of the game designed to enhance the player's immersion in the world.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a game that transcends its medium, a true masterpiece of design, artistry, and storytelling that will stand the test of time.

5532,132804160,"   I'm going to lead with the fact that this is my favorite souls game by significant margin. I have played, enjoyed, and look back fondly on the entire franchise, but something about the first play-through of this game makes the rest look paltry in comparison. Elden Ring takes a franchise renown for its depressing mood, Incredible level design and fair but brutal combat and turns it on its head in one of my favorite reimaginings since Jak 2 on the PS2. 

Tight corridors and claustrophobia have been replaced with a vast open world, dotted with some of the most intricate and brutal zones the franchise has ever presented in the form of Legacy Dungeons. Out in the open world itself, you'll find yourself exploring a series of wondrous and alien environments filled with the remnants of once great civilizations, as well as a variety of World Bosses, Dungeons, Puzzles, Gear, and every assortment of goody the game has to offer. 

There is a degree of repetition to this game, in that some tile sets and bosses can be a little... overused at times. However, I cannot stress the shear scope of this game. I highly recommend playing without spoiling the map, as its truly a treat to watch the world unfold. 

On the same note, visually speaking, this is not the most hyper realistic game you'll ever see. However, it compensates in that it is still ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. From Soft is known for its vistas and ""wow"" moments, and this game takes that to a new degree by constantly making you look around in sheer wonder. From the color scheme to the world design, From Soft manages to take all the ideas that made them famous and redefine them by a golden standard.

Difficulty remains a controversial issue, but I think this is just the right difficulty. If you steamroll ahead, following the Graces and progressing the story alone, you will run into nigh insurmountable odds that will bring on a sweat for even the saltiest souls vet. However, unlike before, you have a massive area full of side content to enrich, empower, and add variety to your combat style, and it will have you tossing bombs, slinging knives, and upgrading that new sword you found in a cave to overcome these massive spikes with a natural ease that reeks of a masterpiece.

Truly, this stands next to Bloodborne and DS3 as masterclasses in the genre, but unlike those, it marks a moment of progression for the series, breaking free from several of its bonds and paving the way for even greater things to follow. Keep an eye out for the next From ""Souls"" game, its going to make this one look terrible.

5542,132801261,"TLDR:
Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph.

GENRE:
Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' game

GAMEPLAY:
Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops.
'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.

Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.

Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.

GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:
Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs. averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient).
In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.

STORY:
The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)

STRENGTHS:
Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.

Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.

Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)

You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.

There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough

The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.

Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.

Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.

WEAKNESSES:
PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens.

Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.

Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.

There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.

UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items

Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player.

Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.

(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.

So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).

'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power.

Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.

NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):
9.9/10; easy recommend

Elden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it.

The 'open field' functions similarly enough to the previous games' level structure, the addition of the map is quite useful (and gorgeous). Areas are beautiful and varied, though some may say the variety detracts from an overall theme/aesthetic - DS3 nailed this thematic consistency in my opinion, which elden ring lacks a little. I had a great time with this game - until Mountaintop of the Giants, where the game became more of a slog (though still enjoyable) with later areas lacking landmarks.

5571,132791484,"Allora, questa recensione farà piangere i cringioni fanboy ma infondo ci sono abituato.

Da dove iniziare?

Partiamo dal presupposto che non siamo di fronte ad un titolo divertente. Un souls-like casa From divertente? Comprensibile come domanda, ma lasciatemi spiegare:

Avendo completato chissà quante volte ormai tutta la trilogia souls, mai mi sono [/i]stancato[/i] di giocarci mid run. Certo, ci sono stati momenti di rage dovuti più che altro ad uno sviluppo fatto con il culo ma infondo pochi giochi posso vantare di essere veramente perfetti.

Dunque il problema si pone qui, l'averlo abbandonato svariate volte perché non mi stava invogliando a farlo è un bel problema, dovuta alla mancanza di un vero obbiettivo; ""gne gne aiuta la frignona melinda a bruciare l'anello così salvi il mondo"" (Mi ricorda l'avventura di un gruppo di gnappette ma ok). 
No, darmi una mappa grossa come il Texas, piena di briciole di patatine con un'obbiettivo così generico e vago è una combo disastrosa.

Per fortuna si sono accorti che un solo finale misero come quello sarebbe stato un suicidio, così si sono messi d'accordo per farne altri e almeno Ranni risolleva un minimo la trama; sarà perché puoi interagirci, sarà perché non è criptica ma ti da delle istruzioni precise, sarà che interagirai con altri personaggi a lei legati fanno si che sia l'unico finale degno di nota.

Ora. Non che nei souls ci fosse chissà quale interazione con gli npc o una trama sfonda cervelli, ma almeno li non dovevi andare a tentoni raccogliendo briciole per capire che [/strike]minchia[/strike] fare e sopratutto dove andare. ""Uhe Uhee ci sono i falò che nella mappa ti indicano dove andare Uhee"", certo, una linea gialla che indica approssivamente 300 Km cubici di mappa inesplorata con all'interno 20 falò e solo uno che indica quello successivo.

Difatti il problema più grande è appunto l'eccessiva ampiezza di una mappa priva di unicità, che per renderla dinamica, hanno spammato le stesse cose da fare, semplicemente aumentando la vita dei nemici presenti. Mettermi 236 (stando alla wiki) boss non rende il gioco più bello, sopratutto se metà di questi si riciclano a vicenda, ma solamente una completition list noiosa e sopratutto toglie quel senso di pericolosità e fierezza che avevano i boss. Ormai tutto è un boss, al punto che alla fine molti di essi li ritrovi come nemici da due soldi in qualche zona più avanti.

Di conseguenza, trama banale e vaga, mappa eccessivamente grossa e priva di contenuto unico, stragrande maggioranza di boss senza una caratterizzazione e solo due elementi che si salvano: Scenari effettivamente belli, certe angolazioni del fiume Siofra sono incredibili e un gameplay fluido, ma grazie al [/strike]cazzo[/strike] è un copia e incolla di DS3 quindi funziona per forza.

Quindi in definiva, dare una sufficienza a questo titolo è impossibile, game of the year rubato aggiungerei, per un titolo che è solamente un souls open world vuoto e senz'anima, che cerca di ricalcare i passi dei suoi predecessori, aggiungendo novità ma in malo modo.

Mi dispiace per chi, toccando il suo primo souls-like, giochi a Elden Ring perché finito questo, si ritroverà senza una vera e propria conoscenza di questo genere.",2023-02-13 20:34:45,True,0,0,False,False,197,22,3177,0,3177,2023-02-07 13:25:15,526,-0.6553,negative,2 stars,0.46547465664999826

5576,132790253,"if youve never played a FROM game before you might like this one! if you are a long time fan of dark souls expecting a new and exciting experience however... this game will not be satisfying. it has very few differences even in plot and tone with any of FROMs other games. i know people wanna believe the repeating themes serve some kind of purpose. it seems more like cope to me. even if it does mean something, its not any less played the fuck out! at this point its painfully formulaic. and i dont mean in the souls like genre. its for the most part the same team making the same game over and over. do the games keep taking place in empty post disaster worlds because its a stylistic choice or is it because its easy to design? after 7 different titles im thinking its the ladder. 

its gameplay is dark souls. no differences whatsoever. bloodborne was unique. sekiro was unique. this has almost no improvements compared to dark souls. instead of improving anything they decided to bloat the game with meaningless and lazily designed features. crafting is practically unused because the drop rates for ANYTHING is egregious!!! The Great runes are largely meaningless and their effects are abysmal for the effort of finding and climbing the right tower. 10% more max hp is as good as it gets. it feels like they quickly jammed this stuff in just to advertise it as a feature instead of actually making it a feature. 

the open world is the emptiest and loneliest world i have ever been in. NOTHING HAPPENS! EVER! it rains and fucks over your fire damage occasionally. THATS IT!! the only things of any note are all right in the beginning. the giant dropping from the arch overhead. agheal swooping down. the carian rain of arrows. all the stuff youve already seen in trailers. it is somehow an open world game where every single run is the exact same. nothing different happens. 

the npcs are cardboard. they never move. and if they do its between resting at graces. they will say everything in cringy and cryptic ways and basically tell you to go somewhere without any directions. in later patches there is a marker automatically placed where you need to go. was it really so hard for blaidd to say WHERE the comet hit? i wouldve settled for simply ""where we first met."" but nah. theres now an unmarked hole somewhere. go find it. i wouldnt complain about getting lost if the world were at all interesting. this game feels like im a dumb little kid again playing a roblox fan game on an empty server. the enemies are pathetic and easy. its not even worth killing for how little runes anything drops besides bosses. its so boring.

which reminds me. this game of the year game has the Worst multiplayer in existence. how hard was it to do what the seamless co op mod does? if you want to progress the game with a friend you have to beat each area per player. while getting invaded by another player. why is there no option to AT LEAST prevent invasions? i dont care about this games roblox tier pvp leave me alone! if i could at least complete one area with another player without getting harassed by a pack of ego maniacal neckbeards playing dress up. this review whould be a touch more positive. but dear christ win or lose, you and your friends are getting hatemail. oh you thought league of legends was toxic and un fun? just wait till you make the mistake of winning against an invader. nothing is more persistant than a PvPer with a hurt ego. youll never see or hear the last of them till they invade again and win or have threatened and called you every insult and slur in existance. holy shit its bad. 

balance is downright nonsense. i had so much fun actually playing sorcerer for once. and then my whole world crumbled when i found the glintstone kris... the sorcery Comet is the single strongest projectile in the game fully charged it costs 24 fp to cast. glint stone kris is a dagger that just fires a STRONGER FASTER VERSION of Comet for 10 fucking fp!?!? that pretty much destroys any reason to use spells outside of specific uses. this isnt the only case of weapons arts blowing spells out of the game. lightning incantations are pretty good! but out damaged by weapon art versions of spells. its INSANITY how bad this design choice is. the only reason to use them is because it looks cool. thats IT!

i try so hard finding a good fun way to be proud of a run. thats a problem with this games erratic difficulty. i wont argue that the game is to hard or easy because its neither. IT IS BROKEN! bosses are either impossible or trivial depending on your playstyle for instance. if your plan is to do the classic swing swing damage strat. you are sure to beleive that this game is hard. thats because boss IA is reading your inputs and even your queued inputs including rolling and flasks. even worse, bosses are able to cancel attacks or animations with eachother. this combination of mechanics basically creates bosses who truly NEVER STOP ATTACKING. if you keep rolling the boss will keep trying to quickly punish it by starting a new attack string. if you dodge that he will just do it againagain until it lands a hit thus actually letting it continue its intended attack string. every death in this game can be summed up with ""oh i thought they were done."" some bosses are able to cancel their own hitstun! yeah thats insanely broken! theres another weird interaction where sometimes if you poise break a boss while its attacking it will suddenly be doing the attack when they recover. for instance. falling star beasts charge can be interupted by hitting it in the head. letting you get some hits in. but when it gets up it will suddenly resume the charge full speed with no warnings. commander niall has a massive Aoe attack that he has to charge up first. if you break his stance during the charge up and reposte him. after he gets back up he will suddenly be doing his massive Aoe with you stood right next to him. there is no way this is intended game design! theres broken shit like this but also the player can just use any straight sword and spam square off the entire game. AND THAT WORKS! margit will have his poise broken after 2 uses. this game is such a fuckin mess!!! AND IT GOT GAME OF THE YEAR wtf!? this only scratches the surface of shit thats wrong.

this game is carried so hard by everyone's hype.  its really just a $60 roblox experience with somehow worse PvP. 

for the love of god start criticizing games again people! just because miyazaki and martin made it doesnt mean its automatically good. no game should be exempt from actual criticism in the way this game has been for the last year. like seriously guys. fanboys praise this game for shit done in the 90s. wowies it took over 10 years to program horses. is this just a big joke im not a part of or something?",2023-02-13 20:08:21,False,4,0,True,False,80,15,11315,316,10998,2023-03-07 00:21:19,1239,-0.9974,negative,2 stars,0.5453737143959317

5680,132759122,"My gripes with this game run deep.  Starting with the console style gaming.  I play PC for a reason... keyboard and mouse primarily.  Being forced to play where a controller design is intended is very annoying to me.  The game world is vast, and beautiful, and fun to explore.  Enemies look interesting.  The atmosphere is great.  Those are the only pluses I would attribute to Elden Ring.  Combat ruins the game however, in my opinion.  The camera control is lousy and locked targets will switch mid-combat to targets you are not even engaged with.  It is always fun fighting an enemy directly in front of you and having the camera rotate 180 degrees because it randomly locks some enemy behind you.  At that point, you are still facing and fighting the front enemy but with the camera spinning, missing all your attacks, and not even knowing which way is up or down after the vertigo the game puts you through.  Every fight is painful and it is not because of how the enemy fights most of the time, but rather, it is because of how lousy the controls are with keyboard and mouse.

I also believe in fair combat for games, with a decent AI.  Elden Ring is anything but this.  Once you start going into boss fights, all they do is stay on you with either their 10x speed movement, or jump onto you from the other side of the arena.  Your character is very sluggish in comparison.  Not only is enemy boss movement at super speed, but they do not have status bars themselves, other than HP, so they spam boss abilities.  To me, I find it to be a cheaty and lousy AI.  It's not really about tactics but more about learning the rotations and timings.  The AI is just not good.  A lot of people say ""git gud"" but I think that should be directed at these companies for not developing any kind of decent AI in these games and just going with the same old worn-out model every single time.

This game feels like a step backwards.  Instead of meaningful combat, this game is all about timing that dodge roll.  I find it sad that games have not progressed beyond parkour and the dodge roll. >.>",2023-02-13 07:41:42,False,0,0,True,False,228,51,8492,1123,6372,2023-02-28 01:42:55,381,-0.9947,negative,2 stars,0.4530578970909119

5714,132753030,"You know when you read a fantastic book series that evokes your imagination? You know when those books are sometimes super detailed to really drive in the importance of normally small or mundane things? Tolkien kind of does that. Have you ever seen a movie that draws you in with its presentation, the way certain images have a symbolic power and presence the way a great painting does?

Combine these two, and make it into a game where you can walk around such a detailed setting constructed by layers of context and themes and symbols, and you have Elden Ring. It's a game about many things: overcoming hardship, rejection of a corrupt status quo, beautiful sights and exploration, wicked monsters and fantastic characters, and it's also about family and tragedy. It's about many more things, too. What makes Elden Ring great is that, like many FromSoft games, you don't have to pay close attention to the story to keep the game interesting. To play is fine on its own. But the storytelling--which really means ""presentation of the setting"" in this context--of Elden Ring is exceptional, it is simply art. There is much to gawk at, to consider, to discover, to converse over, to love and to hate. Elden Ring can be played fast and intensely, or slowly and thoroughly. Elden Ring can be tackled as a gamer, or as a historian. Or both, if you are so bold, or at least as invested as I am. I have 700 hours in this game as of right now. It is a phenomenal mark in the history of games--proof that a video game can be as deep, powerful, evocative as the works of Tolkien.  

I think that to consider things like ""bullshit attacks"" or ""poor pvp balancing"" or ""recycled use of content"" as detractors of the game to the point where it affects judgment of the piece as a whole, would be like seeing a few typos or different spellings of the same character's name in a great book and then saying the whole book is lesser for having those 'mistakes'. It would be ignoring the purpose or importance of what the piece accomplishes--the book could have the literal best narrative possible but because it has spelling mistakes, you put it aside. That's stupid; it has nothing to do with what the piece is about. Such is the case with Elden Ring. Gameplay, here, is not the number one priority for being the best part of the piece.

I didn't expect to be able to run the game on high graphics and get smooth FPS, but I'll be damned. The scenery is a sight to behold and the NPCs alongside it just make the game so dynamic.
Despite some of the bosses being hard and, sometimes, tedious to fight, they're still enjoyable to go against and the feeling of achievement after beating them is very fulfilling.
This game has a very good replay value to the point where I'm content with starting a new build to try out other challenges or endings, or even to see if I had missed out on major quests or bosses since there is a LOT to this game.

[h2]Short Game Description[/h2]
Elden Ring is another great souls-like game from ""From Software"", that improves on many mechanical aspects, and on world building, in comparison to previous Dark Souls.
[list]
[*][h3]Positives[/h3]
Discussing the positives, first of all, the gameplay on this game is improved on many aspects, in terms of combat (like, jumping while attacking), the addition of fast-traveling from the map, and the possibility of riding a horse. Secondly, the world building, it's impressive, there are dungeons, unique buildings,  many unique tematic areas,  and the transition between them. Thirdly, the boss fights are very exciting and amazing at the same time as challenging. Additionally, the soundtrack is awesome, an epic one,
[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]
On the side of negatives, I will point out the bad optimization, which includes many FPS drops, low FPS, and unusually random crashes, provoking a less enjoyable experience. Lastly, some bosses where really repetitive, mostly the dungeon bosses.
[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]

5799,132738906,"First time to not recommend a From Software Game and even though I had my fair share of fun in it I cannot simply give it a thumbs up. Elden Ring has proved itself to be a huge disappointment and in many areas even a shitshow, especially from the PVP side of things.

here is a list of things that don't sit well with me:

- too much unbalanced and broken stuff geared towards the casual players that can use that to insta-kill without any skill needed for execution. All thanks to the needy-greedy content creators on youtube the game is at all times infested by users of the same OP shit.
-Implementing jumping along with jumping attacks was a huge mistake for pvp. They are way too safe with added i-frames, deal too much damage and don’t cost much stamina. Especially terrible on dual curved sword users with bleed that hit 4 times in one jump.
- Fighting system resolves around jump attacks, weapon art spam and whatever else broken mechanics the game currently has to offer to make a casual feel like a god without any skill requirement whatsoever. A nightmare when facing ganks.
- Huge lack of variety in movesets between weapons. 
- Lots of movesets part are redundant. It was so nice to see additional moves and maneuvers, but you quickly notice after a while that a lot of them are pointless. I also really missed the heavy chain continuity pattern after a roll from DS3 in which you would actually do the second attack right away and not the first that you would do from neutral.
- Invasions are incredibly host favored with them having all their flasks and on top of that at least one or two friends with them. Single hosts can only be invaded if they specifically >invite< invaders... -_-
- Invading near/far is good, but getting back your runes is a drag, especially since the marker on the map is easily overseeable. 
- Implementing sneaking was nice, but being able to spam it and hence teabag other people only promotes toxicity (some people are even so lazy that they use it for bowing smh).
- Shallow implementation. You can just run past everything. Nothing ever really stands in your way except very few gate keeper bosses. There is no reason to actually fight the creatures around you - none whatsoever. The world is empty and shallow. Exploring solitary sites seldomly bears anything as reward. 
- Late game areas are poorly designed and don't provide anything really worthwhile for exploring.
- ng+ and beyond is pointless unless you need a specific item that you missed in a quest or that you want to have a second time.
- bosses are ridiculously easy when fighting in a group. Since you can also summon spirits you can make it also incredibly easy offline.
- Boss design is nowhere near DS3 level  (which were challenging, fun and had incredible soundtrack). Some bosses are lackluster and bring in unfair mechanics to raise the difficulty artificially. The final bosses are all terrible in that regard. Beatable sure, but no fun fight really. Other bosses are usually just copy pasta variants of what you have fought before. There are actually only quite a few unique bosses. The OSTs of the bosses is not really noteworthy. Radagon’s fight theme is the only memorable and great piece (as it is basically the main theme). 
- Terrible camera that will get you killed. For instance when close to walls or when facing giant/gigantic foes (looking at you fire giant!) 
- Most players get items duped from the getgo which destroys any early game natural balances the game originally had. Nothing has been done on that front – ever.
- High level players with late game equipment are often summoned and act like guard dog on steroids. Downleveling does not work well in this game at all. Damage-wise they melt anything in their way. GG From Soft...
- when you die to a night opponent you have to set the day time to night everytime AND sit at the site of grace again to them spawn again. So much wasted time.
- Overall unfortunately the replayability of this game is scarce. Too much copy pasta content (lots of sekiro stuff including OSTs too), too many lackluster obstacles, too few actual rewards that give incentive to proceed to ng+

Even during the last couple of days playing I was still discovering new areas and mini bosses. To me, the game is a symbolic representation of depression. Your ability to overcome seemingly impossible odds the more and more you play carries you through out the vast world you were dropped into. Despite the grandeur of the world you journey through, the lack of people and the sense of isolation also become a sub-textual foe. This game has taught me that no matter your skill, you previous experience or, your enjoyment over current circumstances: your mental fortitude is a key instrument to persevere throughout life.

5846,132730812,"Don't let the difficulty hype discourage you. This is just a common RPG game minus the quest markers and journals, quick saves, and tutorials. Like any other RPG, you'll die if you play it like an action FPS. Pay attention to your surroundings and you'll do fine. There is tons of info online to get you going if you want to start the game off easy or if you need more info about anything in the game. I didn't feel like any of the game mechanics were poorly implemented or frustrating, it actually plays very well, at least with a gamepad. I fought all of the optional story or shard bearer bosses and only one of them was a major pain. I didn't 100% the game, but completed various dungeons, cleared the underground areas, and explored much of the overworld area; completed all that in 120 hours.

Never had the game crash or consistently stutter, its main issue is that it is single-threaded. It will try to use all of one CPU core, so it seems like it might briefly lock if something else wants to use that CPU core, but that might have happened 3-4 times for me. I played with an i7-9700K + RTX3090 and the game ran smooth 99.999% of the time. The game may briefly stutter after updating video drivers, I assume it's compiling shaders, but that seems to go away within a minute.

From is basically the Japanese version of Bethesda, they've been building on the same engine for an eternity, stamping out cookie-cutter games running on newer iterations of that engine, so don't expect an audio/visual masterpiece.

5858,132728719,"I have to first mention that i like to call myself a ""souls-veteran"". I have played every souls game except Demon s souls and completed them several times! (DS, DS2, DS3, Sekiro, Bloodborne, Elden Ring). I know what im getting myself into when playing these types of gamer or ""souls-likes"" as you would call them. 

Now onto the game itself, i have to say that since this is a souls game it is NOT for everyone, and you WILL die over and over and over until you finally beat that piece of s*** that killed you all those times (looking at you Malenia). That is the formula of these games, you die several times until you memorize the enemy s attacks and get a better chance at beating them. 

But i must also say that even though this is a souls game, in my personal opinion it is a good game for new players to the series, as you are not forced to fight everything you stumble upon. You can choose to fight that particular enemy over and over for several hours or you can decide to explore somewhere else, and come back later as this is the first time a souls game has gone full Open-World. 

In terms of gameplay there is a lot of different options for players, you can for example use a staff and deal magic damage from long range or choose to summon a FREAKING DRAGON HEAD to spew fire or frost or poison atyour enemies! You can choose to be a big burly warrior with a big a** sword, or you can choose to be more agile and dual wield katanas.

Without spoiling anything too much for new players i have to say that the world is absolutely AMAZING, and the colors can range from pretty and green to red and downright terrifying. (people who has played the game know what i mean by RED and TERRIFYING). 

The only complains i have is that the endgame is BULLS*** as enemies deal WAY too much damage, and can also take quite a few hits even with the best weapons and equipment in your arsenal. And the game can stutter in some areas quite often.

In summary, i think Elden Ring is a fantastic game from the genius mind of Hidetaka Miyusaki, and i reccomend people try this game!

This game checks all the boxes:
Intricate character customization
Great weapon and armor aesthetics
Beautiful World
Fantastic story line
NPCs have character depth
Actually challenging
Rewards exploration

In my opinion this games world is so full of places to explore that actually feel rewarding. A lot of games I play these days while still being good games have left me feeling as though the worlds themselves are empty regardless of how open they may be. In Elden Ring I feel there is constantly something new to find or something that I passed up on a previous play through. That alone is enough to keep me playing the game for hours, I definitely feel like I have gotten my money's worth. I have logged 900 hours on playstation as well as these 153 on PC. after the work they put into it on PC it runs much better and I encounter very little issues. 

If I really had to pick something to list as a con (and this is some deep nit picking) I suppose it would be the grass rendering. On PC it can feel as though it pops up aggressively and suddenly, and this doesn't seem to change regardless of any tinkering with the settings. That being said, it's by no means a game breaker.

5920,132713635,"Pros : level design and art direction

Cons : everything else : unbalanced difficulty that goes all over the place, ridiculous final boss, bosses being generally easier than fights against mobs...all the problems inherent to fromsoft games are back with a vengeance (ennemies that never fall off edges, that have infinite stamina and can combo you to death, that hit you through walls, that track you perfectly, etc etc etc).

A decent game that suffers from a lot of balance problems at best, and that feels cheap, lazy, unfair and hard for the sake of being hard at worst. The lock on system and camera are PREHISTORIC, just don't work properly, and are one of the reasons people think this game is ""hard"". It isn't, it's made artificially hard by dated mechanics that are dumbed down on purpose (eg input buffering, enemies reading your inputs, etc). With more modern mechanics we see in every game nowadays, elden ring would be trivially easy. Outdated game systems from 20 years ago are what makes the game hard.

All in all, it isn't as good as DS1, suffers from the same flaws, and just uses the best ideas fom it without ever managing to equal them. Eg ; I felt suterranean shunning ground was just a cheap and dilluted version of blighttown...most of the good ideas from ER are recycled from previous games.

A pretty good game, absolutely RUINED by a ridiculously unfair and cheap final boss and equally unfair and cheap mechanics that have plagued FS games since DS1.

5.5/10

EDIT : New game + is incredibly boring and pointless, appart from the sublime level design (all over again) and crushing everything with absurdly overpowered stuff. It's the easy mode. I don't get it.

Chances are you already got the best stuff from your first playthrough.

PLUS playing new game + makes all the ""busted"" mechanics feel even more cheap and obvious and will kinda ""taint"" your feelings on the whole game.

The combat feels clean simple to learn, difficult to master lots of flash backs to Zelda and Scrolls and other large open world exploration. 

Class options have some interesting customisation options and combos that make messing around with builds compelling.

The story line was average and they could of used some more interesting names than everything starting with M or G, I cant remember names at the best of times so spent most of the game confused or lost who was who and why I should care.

The locations, puzzle dungeons and sometimes crazy ideas make for a very compelling game and the want to play again with a new build. The mount felt fun to use and the checking every hole and drop felt fun. However...

Negative: The bosses for the large part (not all but most) are just hot garbage, and are the one and only reason I wont consider a replay. Its been mentioned by better people before me, but the ability spam and almost zero time spent balancing them is clear, they feel like a sad after thought rather than a key part of the game and the ones that feel good are just average when compared to other games.

6051,132673516,"This is one of the video games of all time. There is no doubt about that. Still, this is not a perfect 10/10 game for me and I will try to explain what I like and dislike about this game. This review is mostly spoiler free.
This is my first Fromsoft game and some of the points may apply to all Fromsoft games I only played the first hour of DS3 so I don't know much about other FS titles.

Things that I like:

There is an insane amount of content to do.
The exploration in early game feels really good and rewarding. You will meet/find something interesting and useful everywhere you go.
There are 300+ weapons,60+ summons 150+ spells, 500+ armor pieces for you to find and make your build.
The game feels like a true open world, just go and do whatever you like.
You can add awesome skills to your weapon.
You can change your weapons' scaling if it's a normal weapon. If you're running a dexterity build and want to wield that Berserk greatsword? You only need the base strength requirement then you can make the sword 
scale from dexterity by chaning it's affinity.
You can wield very large weapons with one hand most other games will not let you do this.
The game is somewhat difficult but you can complete everything, even if you are bad at the game, by using the tools game give you.
Playing multiplayer is rewarded with a useful item which is difficult to farm in singleplayer.
This is not an entirely sword & roll game, you can make all kinds of bombs, potions, throwing knifes, apply coating to your weapons to inflict elemental damage etc.
The game has funny things in it like a big jar dude and funny armors
Level and World design is astonishing.
Environmental storytelling is very strong. You can tell a lot about what happened in an area just by looking.
You can play this game as hack&slash game or survival horror game all depends on your build. 
[spoiler] bro becomes a meteor [/spoiler]

Things that I dislike:

Repeating bosses. Some bosses will appear 10+ times. I know it is very difficult to fill a map this big with unique bosses but if you care about it you should know this before. They could have made the world smaller and nobody would complain.
Dungeons all feel samey, same enemies with same layoutat the end there will be a the same boss room.
The quest system is bad. If you're playing this blind without looking stuff online, chances are, you are going to miss a good portion of the game. NPC quests are literally you talk to a guy then he teleports to 
a random location and you talk to him again and repeat. 
To unlock 2 entire endgame areas you need 2 items, one drops from a boss and the other one is at a totally random location where you have to hit a random pot to get it.
In the endgame exploration is meh, you do some platforming & fighting and find an item, ""upgrade material 6"" but you can buy the same thing infinitely for a small price at that point.
Game performance is bad, the game runs on less frames than some other open world rpg with similar graphics.
After you made it into endgame the difficulty spikes up considerably. Not only the bosses but normal mobs will 1-2 shot you unless you have very high health and heavy armor then maybe 2-4 hits. There are normal enemies that 
are harder to kill than most of the bosses. The difficulty is unbalanced. There is a boss type of enemy guarding the main boss arena door. He is harder to defeat than the real boss inside. He is on horseback but you can't use your horse,
no summons, nowhere to hide from his ranged attacks. He also has more health & hits harder and you can't land a crit attack on him.
Certain enemies will punish you for healing, the moment you drink your health potion they will launch a long range attack to interrupt you. People call it input reading and I think it is pure BS.
Some fights have a rythm and flow, you can dodge attacks intutively. Some other fights have delayed attacks to trick you. The dude holds his sword up in the air for 5 seconds and you wait for it. I don't think this is fun and does not fit into the context of ""melee fighting"".
A few enemies spawn fires on ground, when you touch it the fire will kill you instantly. This doesn't make sense when you touch fire it sets you on fire then you take damage slowly.
You fight very large enemies to die attacks you can't even see since you're just attacking his foot and tickling down his health.
Good and interesting characters with very little screentime.
Enemies and regions have static level. You are over or under leveled most of the time. You will discover a castle to insta kill the boss inside since you leveled up too much
Coop mode is limited, the game limits you in an area with the goal of beating the area boss. You will be sent back to your world after defeating the area boss.
There are very useful craftable items which require collectibles that are limited in the world or very tedious to grind. Some aspects of the game are similar to MMORPGs where you farm item b so you can farm item a.
Input Buffering, if you press roll 2 times quickly you will roll again after done rolling. This input system is almost never useful it is only there to punish you for spamming buttons.
Story is average, there are interesting side quests and lore elements but the main story of the game is you wake up and kill everything. If you look at it there is no story in the game, only a very small number of events happen in your playthrough. A normal playthorugh is literally ""go kill the main boss"",
""ok i made it to the main boss but the door is locked"", ""go kill 10 other bosses to unlock the door"", ""kill the main boss"". The game is not story driven but lore driven.
One of the questline and ending is confirmed to be mistranslated (the ending turns out to have a complete opposite meaning) from the original Japanese script in to English. This raise the question; how much of this game is translated accurately?
Second phase of the final boss is the worst type of video game boss. That one boss hits you once and runs 10km away and you chase him the entire figth kind of boss. Many people say the figth was designed with your horse in mind but they forgot to enable it.
The game has a system where if a merchant NPC dies you will obtain their shop item and their shop will be available in the hub world. At first this seems like the devs don't want you to miss anything in the game but this is a total scam. You can still miss items.",2023-02-12 03:53:00,True,1,0,True,False,105,5,5407,0,5258,2023-02-15 08:24:54,1202,-0.9994,negative,3 stars,0.4620311512396886

6061,132671792,"This is the first review I've ever written, so go easy on me. But as a new Souls player myself I wanted to write about my experience for others looking into the games of the genre for the first time.

[h1] Overview [/h1]

This game is truly phenomenal, and breathtaking at times. Having tried FromSoft games in the past and rage quitting at the first boss because I couldn't get past it, I was a little skeptical of purchasing this game. However the world looked beautiful and I decided to give it a try. 

Immediately I was sucked into The Lands Between and its beauty. The world is massive and if you think you can go somewhere you probably can. Combat takes a bit to get used to, but doesn't take too long to become proficient, but can take hours to master. The lore is so deep it is always rewarding when you find a new snippet and can piece together a little bit more about the history of The Lands Between. Questing can be quite difficult at times trying to figure out where to go and what to find, but is very rewarding when you make it to the next step. This game is not for everyone, but it has a lot to offer.

[h1] World [/h1]

Once I opened the door and saw Limgrave for the first time I was taken back at how beautiful it was. After taking in the Erdtree and Stormveil off in the distance I took off into The Lands Between to see where I could go. I was not expecting it to be as open as it was. If you think you can get somewhere, chances probably are that you can get there. 

On my quest to acquire all legendary item in the game on my second play-through I explored every nook and cranny in the Lands Between. It blew me away all the places I missed, or thought were unreachable. It also took me to some of the most beautiful places and also some of the hardest, but it pays off greatly to explore.

[h1] Gameplay/Combat [/h1]

Elden Ring is a lot more forgiving than other Souls Borne games due to its open world design. However, it can still pose quite a challenge if you want it to. I say this because Elden Ring is a true open world where as other FromSoft titles are more linear and require some bosses to be beaten to access the next area. There are some areas blocked by bosses in Elden Ring, however, a lot of the word can be accessed without having to engage in these fights. If you get to a boss you cannot beat you can go back into the world to find a better weapon or level up some more to get more prepared. Whereas in other Souls titles you'd just have to ""git gud"". But if you want a more ""true"" souls experience you do have the option to go straight to bosses and fight until you git gud. 

While I haven't tried all weapon types and styles of combat yet, the combat feels very good. While its a little tedious to learn for new players it does not take too long to be able to at least have a chance against enemies, and theres plenty of areas with smaller bosses to get good and practiced up before going up against main bosses. There are also many different types of weapons that cater to different combat styles so there is something for everyone. Some weapons like colossal weapons are for more experienced players but there are very viable options for people new to this style of game and still make it an enjoyable experience given its difficulty at times.

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]

Elden Ring is a beautiful game with a vast open world that highly encourages and rewards exploration. The combat feels very good and offers things to both new and veteran players. The lore is very deep and there is a ton of it if you want to look for it. Which I do highly recommend as makes a fascinating story. If you are wanting to get into Souls Borne games this is a great intro into their genre.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce (optional, for added flavor), salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours.
When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees.
Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly.
Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.
Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.

6097,132663732,"My lord, is this game something that gets me going.

I have had games like this, but this one stands out. You know those games that just make you look for every little detail, looking stuff up to find out more and whatnot, yes, this is that.

I remember my first time playing it through - Looking at the map trying to find something that stands out, whether buildings or rubble, going there and finding something new. This feeling is amazing.

Questing, still sucks as it does in Dark Souls, you could get lucky and blindly follow or they actually tell you to go somewhere, but most of the time, good luck. Wish they could've added a little notebook which writes out clues that as if you the character is writing them down, so you can piece the hints together to know what to do next.

Gameplay is good ol' Dark Souls, run your head into bosses, beat them, get dopamine, only now most of the time you can sidetrack and get leveled if you get stuck at a boss, which can be a bad for hardcore souls-like connoisseurs, for me, I liked it, gave me a reason to side track and find new shit.

PVP - eh never been into it, and as I know, pretty dead.

Music is as expected from fromsoft, some of the best, when you launch the game and the tune plays. One word. SHIVERS.

6103,132662113,"This is honestly the worst Soulsborne game. The biggest problem is the bosses. If you play without spirits, you often have to dodge the boss for 20-30 seconds before you finally get an opportunity to get a hit in and go back to dodging for 30 seconds. The bosses lack a serious back and forth aspect, and that makes the fights very unsatisfying. This is without mentioning that bosses will randomly add attacks to the end of combo strings that seem ""safe."" Thus, the fight basically requires rote memorization through trial and error to understand which boss attacks are truly ""safe"" to respond to with an attack.

 If you play with spirits, the bosses become extremely easy and you essentially just abuse the enemy ai flaws. For a series known for its bosses, this game has very few fun boss fights.

The next biggest problem is the open world. While the world is somewhat fun to explore in your first playthrough, the loot often feels spread way too thin compared to past games because unlike past soulsborne games, Elden Ring is an open world game. You often find crap that is irrelevant to your build waiting to find something that may finally get you to change weapons/armor/spells. And in the end, the open world. makes replays a complete slog. The best parts of the game end up being the legacy dungeons that aren't used enough. Overall, From Soft finally lost the ball on this one.

Even though a few areas got annoying after a while I very much enjoyed exploring and sometimes just looking at some parts of the world.

There is so much side content that you may not even find. If you want to find things, this time you actually have to look at messages and item descriptions. I myself really enjoyed that. Some say that the reused assets and similar looking caves and dungeons ruin them, but because these areas are completely optional, I am surprised they put even this much effort into those alongside all the other optional and well-hidden areas.

Overall the game is amazing, but this does not mean I would recommend it to everyone. You have to have the affinity to throw yourself at the next thing blocking your way again and again or to try new things until you find a setup that works for the current problem.

6276,132600980,"Elden Ring is one of, if not the most overrated and overhyped games I have ever played. This isn't a ""skill issue"" and I don't need to ""get good"". Pinning blame on the players is a way that I've seen Elden Ring fanboys obfuscate from actual problems the game has. Compared to nearly every other From Software game except maybe Demons Souls or Dark Souls 2, Elden Ring is outshone in nearly every conceivable way. The combat is just unsatisfying, the npcs are some of the worst in the series, and the open world aspect just does not work in the context of a souls-like game. The visual design in this game in general, except for maybe a few specific examples, is just unappealing in a way that makes areas not as interesting as previous games. Elden Ring has inconsistent design philosophies which makes the game feel unnecessarily frustrating at times. The game is filled with gank fights and unnecessary annoyances. A distant ledge that looks to be part of a wall could lead to a secret or may be blocked by an invisible wall that causes you to fall to your death. The game feels like it was made by people who had no communication with each other. The game also suffers from copy and paste, cookie cutter, pre-fabbed dungeons which comprise of nearly all of the games side content. In these dungeons you may find an interesting boss, but it most certainly also appears in at least 3 other dungeons and the reward will likely be not worth the effort you put into the dungeon. All of this could be excused, and I could accept this game as just being a subpar slip into From's library, if not for the atrocious optimization that still hasn't been fixed over a year after release. It is honestly some of the worst I have seen coming from a triple A studio in recent years. If anyone tells you that Elden Ring is their favorite soulsbourne game, either they haven't played many soulsbourne games, or they've seen something in the game that I just haven't. If you are looking to see if this game is worth buying or not, save yourself $20 and buy Dark Souls Remastered instead.",2023-02-11 09:21:11,False,2,2,True,False,240,9,3803,75,3803,2023-03-04 16:51:15,376,0.1133,positive,2 stars,0.5143246173858642

Pvp was fun but pve for me is just the best. I loved going through the game and finding all the mysteries. I've completed the game on my ps4 at about 200 to 250 hours and i've done everything I can find to do. I'm currently playing through with my friend and I'm planning on doing mods. 

The only things I didn't like about the game, were the dungeons and rebirths.

6418,132559176,"[h1] A must play, but only if you have the time [/h1]

I had preordered the game and played around 80 hours in the first month alone. I was absolutely hooked. If I had written a review back then, I would have without a doubt, given it a 10/10. 
The world, the mechanics, the graphics are masterfully crafted and I don't think I have something new to say about these.
However, I had put a pause on gaming for around half a year not because I didn't want to play but because of the lack of time - a predicament most people can relate to. 
These weeks have been a little bit more free for me, so I thought - ""I must download Elden Ring, how much I miss it!"" 
I jumped back into the lands between excited to continue my adventure - only to find out I have absolutely no recollection of what I was doing before, what quests I have picked up and where to go. 
I was left stumbled and found little to no enjoyment in slaying enemies with a character I remember nothing about... Which is a shame.
I'm not saying a quest log and markers like Skyrim's or The Witcher 3 would have made the game better - even the opposite. But a Morrowind style diary about who you met, what they told you and what you did would have avoided this problem altogether - while preserving the direction of the game. 

In the end - I would recommend Elden Ring to everyone who has time to play it every week. If you are a casual gamer with not too much time - save your money for another RPG or wait until you can dedicate your time to finish this masterpiece (What I will be doing)

I don't think any other game has made dark high fantasy look this good, the world and the atmosphere feels like you're in a painting. The game is challenging as per the norm for soulsbornes but due to the large open spaces and ability to run away from MOST situations, the game gives you a lot of freedom to play and level up at your own pace. I've heard from some ""Souls"" elitists that it is not perfect and that the other games do some things better, but that is to be expected that no game is perfect.

THis game kills you in ONE HIT

The tracking in this is better than ever, the mobs and bosses know when im being a distant bitch and when im healing, they can close distances in a second and then they bonk me.

THERE IS VERY many weapons many weapon arts, endless weab cosplay galor. The true challenge of this game is beat it as stylish as possible

This game big... no seriously this game BIIIG the map be fluffy lvl big. The atmosphere felt so nice,finding random areas was jaw dropping,  i cant even explain the visuals and art that this game presents.

I love this game, is it difficult? you can choose how difficult you want it to be, with the much more fluid multiplayer system and big player base you can beat it. The checkpoints in this game are much more lenient than previous titles. 

The series has Helped me control my emotional anger over the years, good game get bragging rights after I Guess praise the sun. Much more fluid than the first 3, and every thing is shinier.

if your seriously struggling look up how to get moonveil or reduvia dagger, find one of the banished knight summons. look up how to upgrade those, prioritize vigor.

6496,132524169,"Elden Ring isn't a perfect game, that much is known. I had some technical issues while playing the game (frame stuttering and the occasional crash), but to say that this isn't one of the best games I've played would be as much of a cardinal scene as [spoiler]burning the damn Erdtree[/spoiler].

Now, I'm a complete newbie to souls-likes. Actually, that's not entirely true because I've played Dark Souls 3, however I've never actually completed the game. Elden Ring was the first game I fully completed and gotten every ending for, so here's my take from a completely newbie standpoint.

I found the lore engrossing, which doesn't happen with me every often. The last time I had enjoyed a good story was deltarune and UNDERTALE respectively. A lot of the characters were three-dimensional and ripe with personality, and I particularly loved every single boss on a design standpoint. I'd say that Placidusax and Fortissax were my favorite, but they're both dragons and I have a dragon bias, so I'll say that Malenia's and Elden Beast's designs were my unbiased favorite.

Combat's challenging, that much is obvious. It's a souls game, I wouldn't expect any hand holding, but it's not difficult to the point where its unfair. You have to seriously time your attacks and dodges just so you're sure you don't come crashing face first into Renalla's moon. You actually have to plan ahead and think instead of rushing in and spamming your ash of war until the enemy drops. Sure, Mohg has the non-preventable nihil attack that procs with blood loss three times, but there's a whole crystal tear meant to counter it. Even then, you can literally survive without it by simply healing every time he procs it. The only one I found a little bit unfair was Malenia's waterfowl dance, but since it's been almost a year since the game's launch, there's already a method to dodge it.

Let's also not forget the open-world aspect of this game. I've gotten all the achievements the game had to offer. Still, even after all of that, after all 114 hours of playing, there's still undiscovered catacombs, caves, questlines, bosses...

The music is great. Don't really need to explain that one.

Overall great open world game. If you like souls like games you'll like this game. The open world itself was very full of life and differences, the areas each having their own flare. The main bosses were all unique characters. Side bosses had some repeats, but with so many bosses its not too surprising and can be forgiven though. its an area of improvement. Difficulty was dynamic depending on how good your build is and what your current level is. There is also lots of help to make the bosses easier like ashes.

The npcs you meet along the way are all interesting and none ever felt same in personality. The weapons and abilities available add a lot of dynamics to combat. If I had to ask for one thing to be done a little better, it would be in the endings. [spoiler] 4 of the 6 possible endings [/spoiler] are a bit samey and uninspired because of that.

I'd say its a 9/10. Well worth the money paid for it. I also didn't play for a few months since the game came out, so I didn't experience any optimization issues I hear mentioned.",2023-02-10 15:21:40,True,0,0,True,False,105,16,10800,0,10800,2023-02-08 01:41:31,203,0.9841,positive,4 stars,0.62935142715772

First play through was by far the most fun, but i beat this game 7 times and going on my 8th. When you first play you are new and everything is a new discovery and everything would have been a 10. Once you do the caves and the catacombs you start to see that its mostly the same but of course with some slight gimmick or trick but it came down to here is another dungeon and boss with a spirit ash as a reward. Bosses were all great but its not a 10 due to using bosses more then once but they do change them a little.

The beginning bosses are pretty decent. Love having a horse to get around, combat can either be great while on Torrent or awful. I do love the game, I completed it three times to get all 42 achievements.

What I did not like: Later bosses, for me, are not fun to fight. It feels good to defeat them but I was also exhausted and still frustrated even though I beat them. I will admit I am not strong at combat and with one boss I had a cooperator help me so I could get the achievement. I do not feel bad about it! Later game also has sparse interactions with regular combat and felt like I just went from one boss and on to another with very little inbetween. I felt there was less to do in regard to exploring in later game, which was a shame as the setting would have been great for it.

Regardless, I would recommend this game. Probably on controller, I played on keyboard and mouse and it was a challenge.

6610,132497447,"I love this game so much, I swear to God. I was introduced to Souls games by a good friend of mine, but truth be told, it was I who got Elden Ring first. As soon as I saw YouTubers playing it, I copped it almost IMMEDIATELY. I gave up a few times, sure. It was my first Souls game after all. But after a few stumbles and encouragements from my friend, I got sucked into the game like crumbs to a vacuum. It's one of my favorite games of all time, if not my MOST favorite.

6698,132479523,"Elden Ring operates on one simple idea:
You, a weak and frail nobody, have to rise to the occasion and slay hideous monsters, gigantic dragons, legendary kings, ancient gods, and even ferocious madness-inflicting rats in order to accomplish your goals.

This is quickly and efficiently established as you unsuspectingly start the game and immediately get splattered across the walls by a sword wielding, acid spewing spider made out of corpses. You have now discovered that you're in a brutal and apathetic environment that will try to kill you regardless of your complaints.

When you mull over that synopsis, what comes to mind? It sounds unfair, doesn't it?
Every aspect of the game is specifically designed to be an obstacle against your progress that you have to overcome, to the point of feeling unfair at many points. And at some points, it is actually unfair. But the task this game demands of you is to put your boots on and push through every obstacle until you finally overcome them, leading to a feeling of accomplishment that wouldn't be there if you just beat the boss in one try.

The basic framework of the gameplay is deceivingly simple, you either attack your enemy, or dodge their attack, but in actuality you will have to consider many aspects like positioning, health and stamina, length and moveset of your weapon, and learn to avoid fatal beginner mistakes like overcommitting on your attacks or panic dodges that get easily punished by your enemies.

The map of the game is truly massive, it is the one of the few, perhaps even the only detailed video game environments that provides a true sense of scale. You see that giant tree? That's not the skybox, that's where you're going. Over the course of the game you will traverse massive lakes, great forests, gargantuan castles, deep and ancient underground cities, and mountainous mountains. Elden Ring succeeds where most open world games fail by being a vertical game, you will be able to visit the highest heights and the lowest depths.

Unfortunately, due to the scale of the world, from a loot perspective exploration is not rewarded nearly as well as previous Fromsoft games. In Dark Souls when you searched through the cracks and crevices of a location off the beaten path you would end up finding a cool sword or armor set, but in Elden Ring it's more likely to be a mushroom for crafting. While this is a valid complaint it's also simply not feasible for the developers to have gone and placed unique items at every little hidden cliffside or dead end. But if you personally enjoy exploration for its own sake and seeing the incredible sights of the game then you won't have any problems.

The most controversial aspect of the game is the multiplayer. The way it works is that you can summon friends into your game to explore together and help you fight enemies. The co-op can be a bit inconvenient because the game doesn't let you go between separate map areas in multiplayer, and it doesn't let you use your horse in multiplayer either. 
The part where people are divided though is the invasion system. When you are playing with friends, another player can invade your world and attempt to kill you in order to halt your progress. Many people buy Fromsoft games thinking that they are exclusively a PvE experience and then encounter invaders and it leaves a sour taste in their mouth.
The problems people have with invaders range from simply not enjoying having their progress halted by another person, to many invaders using broken meta weapons that are very difficult to counter.

To me, this issue with invaders is closely related to the core philosophy of the game. Just like a difficult boss, invaders are yet another obstacle to your quest that the game mercilessly throws at you. Invaders also have their own obstacles, the game throws teams of 2-3 people at them and they have to be good enough to handle the pressure and use their environment as an advantage in their war of attrition. From the invader's perspective, the host and their summons are the boss that must be overcome.

Though I prefer the gameplay, in my opinion as a whole the PvP in this game is a step down from Dark Souls 3. The previous games had a system called covenants, which were essentially factions that a player could choose that had unique matchmaking and item rewards for co-op and PvP. This system is only just barely present in Elden Ring, and it's watered down.
Even in the previous games the rewards for multiplayer weren't that good but now you essentially get nothing except for a good time. The only thing resembling a covenant left in the game are the white and blue cipher rings that respectively allow you to call for help from another player whenever you get invaded or respond to that call for help.

TLDR: This game sucks you in and transports you into a brutal yet beautiful world of fantasy, borrowing heavily from Lord of The Rings and Berserk. 10/10 would solo her again.",2023-02-09 18:10:17,True,1,0,True,False,62,1,15238,0,15238,2023-02-06 21:45:56,861,-0.989,negative,4 stars,0.46869063675403594

Value is absolutely through the roof. Hopefully one day they'll bring some DLC for it. I found the game to be best enjoyed as a slow burn, going through all side dungeons I came across and exploring whatever random side paths I could think of.

6717,132474482,"Okay, what I'm about to review is in no way hyperbolic and should be taken as an incentive to play the damn game: it's a work of brilliance that does everything utterly right. From the scarcely comprehensible plot, to the graphics and atmosphere, to the loot, level and combat system, everything is on the utmost level. The game is unsurprisingly tough, but for a valid reason: you despair of bosses, and to overcome them you simply have to improve; so the game pushes you to be a better, smarter and stronger player, and once you realize that, it's even more rewarding. When you finally defeat the Elden Beast after 100 tries, you have literally become a god at Elden Ring, and you look back mischievously to the start when you originally believed the first boss was unconquerable.

6779,132457004,"I'm a bit of a cheapskate, not to mention my taste in video games tends to steer me away from the $60 triple-a titles. I'm also not usually the biggest fan of open world games either. They often tend to have way too much wide open space or have a bunch of boring npcs with even more boring quests. However I enjoyed Dark Souls III enough to take a gamble on this one. I'm very glad I did. This game respects my monkey brain of ""I wanna run around and kill stuff"" more than any other open world or RPG ever has. While the large set pieces are the stars of the show, likely due to their more linear dark souls-y design, the open areas still have plenty of activities, and the exploration feels very organic, so it never feels like going from point A to point B, but rather ""that building in the distance sure looks interesting, I'll head in that general direction while checking out stuff on the side."" I feel like my $60 has already been worth it, and I've barely made a dent in this game.

Edit: 60 hours in and I do have a few criticisms.

1. The pvp kinda sucks. There's no more random invasions except during co-op, which encourages invaders to be more toxic, since there's a higher likelihood that they'll get 3v1'd. 

2. The game feels way easier than previous souls games. I had a little trouble in the early game but once I got my build settled I've pretty much been steamrolling everything. 

3. There's a lot of copy/paste. I don't mind the repeated enemies and minibosses so much, since there's plenty of other solid games that do similar things. My big gripe is with some of the later game mini-dungeon layouts, which overuse the trope of ""ooo, this layout of rooms is exactly the same as the ones you just went through, oooo, what a labyrinth, you feel lost yet?"" like bruh I though we had stopped doing that shit back in the NES era because we all agreed it wasn't fun. It's fine for like, one or two dungeons as a gimmick, but it got old fairly quick. 

All that being said, the game is still an incredibly good time, and I'll certainly be seeing it through till the end. ",2023-02-09 07:07:53,True,0,0,True,False,114,39,4404,0,4023,2023-02-20 01:49:20,391,-0.5618,negative,4 stars,0.49269744753837585

6782,132456437,"Good game with some MAJOR flaws. What smooth-brained moron thought it was a good idea to give players a +8 weapon when the summoning depends on level and highest weapon level?

If you accidentally get gifted a high level weapon by an NPC (which happens VERY early in the game), then you won't be able to summon or be summoned by most of the population.

The game also tells you to go east after the first area, but the east is actually a mid/late area of the game, so....

Lots of the bosses get stuck on geometry.

The game suddenly gets major lag spikes in the middle of fights (not very often, but still, I'm running a high-end system and there's still lag spikes? Wtf is up with that?).

They removed homeward bones, why? Terrible design choice.

The story is meh, I loved all the souls-borne lore but this game's story isn't very captivating.

The combat, when it works right, is a lot of fun.

The graphics are pretty.

Good sound design.

So-so music (out of all the Souls Borne games, this one probably has the most forgettable soundtrack for me).

Haven't 100% it yet, only finished the story.

All of this was done in 87 hours of play time.

My first FromSoftware game. I would say that I got my moneys worth and some more, given how much I still have left to do. Not a 10/10 simply because a few bosses were quite large, thus making close combat camera quite the challenge, making it hard to dodge (I see you Fire Giant). NPCs would just end themselves if you were to progress past a certain event/boss, not too big of a deal but a few times after I had just defeated a boss I would remember about a certain NPC and visit them to see if they got something new to say or offer, only to be greeted with an item or bell bearing. A bit discouraging but understandable. Context Im not that good at this game BUT my playthrough felt very 1 skill to win them all. Perhaps I was overleveled, although I would get rolled by bosses in 4 to 5 hits I would also roll them in 40 weapon skills or so, perhaps it was my 35 vigor's fault but again not the smartest player here.

I was quite sceptical about getting the game as I knew how difficult the souls games are. It took me a while to get into the game as I had never played a souls game before and the difficulty made me think it was a poorly done game. My opinion, now I have beaten it is drastically different. This game is a true work of art, all the time and effort put into Elden Ring payed of completely. I'm not sure what game fromsofware will come out with next, but if it is as good, and as repayable as Elden Ring I am looking forward to buying it.

But still, what a world FromSoft managed to create! I mostly hate open-world games due to them always being full of boring filler content and boring collectibles, but From got their version of open-world formula almost exactly right.

It's GOTY for a reason.

That being said, expect a little bit of jankiness, but get ready for a huge world to get lost in.
Lots of challenges to tackle in your own way. 
Beautiful screenshot worthy vistas. 
Frustrating and scary moments.
Jaw dropping enemy designs.
Tons of weapons, spells, armor to try out.
Take the time to interact with the characters and read item descriptions to give you an idea of the shattered world your character has arrived in, there's a lot more than meets the eye.

I have a few gripes, namely that there are so many weapons and items but there is a hard limit on how many times you can re-spec your character, it limits experimentation and creativity. The item upgrading system, well, let's be real, a handful of systems are a bit convoluted too.
But don't let that stop you. I recommend a blind experience but look up things when you need to because the game doesn't explain things very well, specially if you're new to souls games. Don't be afraid to try it.

The game at it's core is about perseverance. It's a souls game, it's brutal. Don't give up. Some of the bosses took me days to learn and beat, but the feeling of overcoming a challenge like that is just bliss. 

Take breaks if you need to, explore different areas and try various methods to beat the bosses. Elden Ring has so many more ways to play the game than the older souls games and to make it easier on yourself if you want to by using summons or summoning help.

Game is huge... like HUGE HUGE. Like you think you've discovered the entire map then there's like a million caves and dungeons hidden on the map with their own systems. And each one has a boss area. Then there's like an entire map under the map like wtf. Okay big game.

- The cut scenes in this game are very cool, but it could be made a lot better with just a few small changes. like the cut scene cutting off appropriately, the scenes usually end with the screen fading to black and the music cutting out. This is not a big problem though.

- The story of these games are phenomenal, but it is very hard for a new player to understand what is happening and what their supposed to do. I don't think the game would be better if this was changed, because its kind of a trend in fromsoft games.

I'm too lazy to think of more nit-picks so just buy it if you're looking for a well rounded game that serves a challenge.

It's not that hard, it is but it isn't. Some bosses are way too easy, and others have had me contemplating uninstalling the game. Now, this could be chugged up to ""It was a side boss"" but at last no. The story bosses are inconsistently hard.
Now the open world itself is great like actually phenomenal, I highly recommend exploring it to your heart's content. It's been a while since I got so caught up playing an open world.

- Same boring loop gameplay from 2009 (R1 spam, 8 frame roll, estus ingestion)
- Completly inferior to all from software souls game in terms of OST, i don't remember a song except the main theme
- An aboslute trash map, there's no wonder why it's the first thing they try to patch even tho the FS cult try to defend this stupidity
- A goddamn PowerPoint at the start to explain the ""lore"" of the game like... really ?

6971,132412931,"Look, there are many reasons to dislike or bounce off a Fromsoft game.  They're usually pretty drab and grey and rotting in aesthetic, they're fantastically and infamously hard to the point that a portion of the playerbase is somewhat obnoxious about it, the story tends to be vague and depressing, the controls are a little obtuse.  

But I have generally always *tried* to like Fromsoft games, because they are clearly both genre defining and exceptional at what they are trying to do.  I bounced off every single one that I tried - including this one- until I picked it up again, months later, because I was drawn back by the things I had *liked* about it.  

Elden Ring still has an ugly, drab, rotting aesthetic.  It is also filled with beautiful landscapes suffused with bright color and golden light, and just genuinely impressive visuals all over the place. 

Elden Ring is still hard as hell.  It is also a game that allows you to level up to the point where you can easily handle bosses without having to painstakingly learn every one of their moves, while traversing literally wherever you want, wielding a wide array of toolkits and summons to address problems, and picking and choosing what encounters you think are worth your while.

Elden Rings controls are still obtuse and odd.  They work pretty well on a controller, nonetheless, and as you play you will keep finding oddities in the movesets, little things like attacks you can trigger off of dodges on certain weapons, all the while allowing you to customize and experiment with a huge array of weapons that range from abusively simple to fascinatingly complex.

Elden Rings story is still vague and depressing.  The open world aspect of it makes it fascinating to unpack, with every little piece of the environment and every new character you meet teaching you something fascinating, as well as some characters being *very* upfront with you about the story and the things that have happened.   It's also a game who's rich history was half penned by George R.R. Martin, who as usual is exploring some stuff in a way that just kinda vibes with the general Fromsoft vibe.

It all clicked this time.  So now I am into Elden Ring.  I have roamed the entirety of Lingrave and covered a huge portion of Liurnia and Caelid, I have tried four different characters and am excited about a fifth.  I've learned how to parry and I've learned how to dodge and jump and how to twohand when needed and what spec seems most powerful to me (it's claws and scholarly weapon), and I've learned that all the stats are cool but you should really put points in Vigor too.  Parts of the game seem easy now.  Other parts still have a challenge I am excited to seek.  I'm having a really good time.

I cannot emphasize this enough: it is frankly cooler to like things than to hate them.  It is absolutely more fun to meet a game where it is at and embrace what it is offering.  This game is wildly, perfectly good if you can do that.  And if you do not know how to meet a Fromsoft game where it is at, this is the best possible die roll that you will find a way to.",2023-02-08 10:30:42,True,0,0,True,False,683,20,12222,3388,4193,2023-03-07 10:04:15,556,0.9966,positive,2 stars,0.4689346083572933

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Elden Ring initially gripped me in a way few other games have. The starting area of Limgrave is superbly designed, offering a significant amount of enemy variety, enticing landscapes and plenty to explore. The sense of awe and wonder is strong, perhaps unrivalled among open world games.

The areas that immediately follow it maintain a high level of quality, even if not quite high as the opening area. The repetition of the caves, catacombs, etc. was starting to wear a little thin, the amount of reused bosses was becoming more noticeable and my frustration at how little of the loot I was finding was relevant to my build was growing, but the first fifty hours or so were nevertheless extremely engaging.

Unfortunately, there is a point in the game at which those minor flaws start to become major ones. The enemy variety is extremely front-loaded, leading to dozens of hours of playtime in the latter half of the game fighting almost nothing but reused enemies. Exploration became unrewarding when it began to dawn on me just how few of the things I was finding I even considered using. The repetitive open world filler content had long worn out its welcome.

The more I played, the more I began to think this is not some new, innovative approach to open world design as many people claim. If, for example, clearing out an enemy camp in an Assassin's Creed game is considered a bad example of content to put in an open world, I don't see how clearing out a copy-paste catacomb, fighting a boss I've seen several times before at the end of it and opening a chest to get a weapon I'll never use is much of an improvement. The presentation of this content, choosing not to mark it on the map beforehand and put a check mark next to it when you're done, is welcome. But the standard of the actual content itself once you find it is not any better than what other open world games have to offer.

As with many other open world games, I think Elden Ring would be better if it showed more restraint. There is simply just not enough interesting content to fill its huge world. It's a game with many memorable moments, but almost all of those came in the first half of the ninety-five hours I spent playing it.",2023-02-07 23:01:25,True,0,0,False,False,103,2,5726,0,5726,2023-01-25 13:27:54,400,-0.9429,negative,4 stars,0.5605590999126434

7108,132390253,"Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software’s Elden Ring, an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the genre.
This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the most extraordinary adventures of all time. From my initial foray into the world to the final moments, every step of the journey is a note in a personalized epic that kept me coming back for more. The Lands Between is a world full of discovery, and while a clear path forward exists for those seeking guidance, roaming the lands unfettered without a particular goal in mind often yields surprises. I often had a spot to explore marked on my map and got off-track along the way, sometimes leading to entirely new areas and feature-dense zones. The grandiose world is chock full of characters, quests, and various dungeon crawls ranging from tiny catacombs to massive multilayered tombs. While the journey starts with little caves, mines, and other dungeon delves, these experiences become more complex. Two-room affairs eventually become intricate teleport puzzles or scenarios where you discover unusual ways to interact with the environment, like learning to use traps for traversal or sniffing out secret walls. Your character is incredibly customizable, which I found highly rewarding. You can attach various skills and scaling mechanics across the board, allowing you to truly create your own vision of a traveling hero. Respecialization and alterations allow you to finely tweak your creation without worrying too much about experimentation along the way as you arm yourself with everything from explosive pots to potent perfumes to complement your ever-growing arsenal. The open world is majestic, dripping with flavor and atmosphere, and full of fabulous finds. However, the legacy dungeons are the stuff of legend, often connecting to the outside from multiple points. These curated sprawls are a dream to dissect, and Elden Ring often offers different ways to maneuver through these areas. The big bosses, generally found at the end of legacy dungeons, feel like wonderful wars against demigods. These brilliant set piece battles are thrilling exclamation points to an outrageous odyssey, absolute spectacles, and masterful combinations of tension and triumph. Elden Ring has the distinction of having the best and most challenging boss battle in any From Software game to date. Hidden away and optional, this encounter had me waking up in the middle of the night to come back and crash against its beautiful and terrifying destruction over and over again. After finally besting this opponent, I let loose a triumphant victory roar there while sitting in the dark and wearing my pajamas, wanting nothing more than to experience the encounter again. This example speaks to how unbelievably compelling and immersive Elden Ring is; I regularly put it down with the intent of doing something else and found myself back within minutes. There is always one more gnawing mystery to unravel, one more boss to beat, and one more hidden route to find.

Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and enchanted me, an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound. Elden Ring represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable.

The exploration is absolutely amazing. The bosses are bad. They're visually impressive, often being great spectacles to behold with all their spells and effects, but when it comes to the gameplay itself they're nothing more than cheap. Remember ""tough but fair""? That's gone. Bosses always have lots of huge AoE homing attacks they can spam infinitely, zero down time between attacks, are specially designed with a ""gotcha"" mentality, with attacks specially engineered to catch you not matter what, and all of them have a correct way of being fought here; you either play by the ""meta"" or you're in for a bad time. Like to experiment with different builds and items? Look elsehere, there's no room for it here. I didn't play by the meta 'cause I didn't know what it was until after I finished the game; wanna know how I got through them? Over levelling and brute forcing. They're frustrating even in victory.

7142,132382636,"TL;DR: Decent game, but nothing groundbreaking or innovative in Soulsformula nor in Openworld games really to warrant  goty.

Just to make clear, I do like and enjoy FromSoftware's works. So all respect for Miyazaki and his team. And I like the game, even though to me it is more or less just Dark Souls 4. 
Will most likely still play more and finish ER at somepoint. 
But since there is no ""Mixed"" review I'll give a thumbs down. 
If you liked previous soulsgames and are fan of the genre, then most likely you'll find something to enjoy from here too. If you are new to soulslikes, then this might not be your cup of tea. 
(To add that I wasn't really on the hype train waiting for ER, was more less ""might as well buy for shits and giggles"" and for me it has paid itself back.)

FS has proven time and time again that they can make great worlds with interesting areas, but on Elden Ring, I personally feel that some of the magic was lost due to the shift of open world. I think that From is more strong when building interconnected labyrinths like the ones in Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1 to compare. In ER they've managed to do this the Legacy set pieces very nicely. They are straight up comparable to previous works of FS.

The world is pretty, but pretty alone doesn't make it good. Even with all the vistas and PoI's the world at times feels empty and recycled (Though recycling in ER is a problem in itself at times) and after a while you won't be spending that much time on the map itself anymore since fast travel makes travelling on Torrent obsolete.

I think that ER provides a fair challenge when compared to other soulsborne games, the difficulty is on par and the option of being able to do something else when facing a wall is a nice addition even though you've always had the ability to go back and grind (if one chooses so) unless you wanted to throw yourself against that wall till it breaks.",2023-02-07 19:08:08,False,0,0,False,False,987,19,2050,0,2050,2022-03-19 16:03:41,355,0.9949,positive,3 stars,0.5013287737965584

7154,132380577,"I have been playing FROM Software games since DS1 came out on the 360. I have tried to like these games over and over. I have played DS1 from many different angles and many different classes, but have never seen the appeal. To me, playing these games just feels like training yourself to be really good at executing a half-baked feedback loop process with extremely broken tools, and Elden Ring is no exception. Not only does this game exemplify everything wrong with the design of FROM games, but it doesn't even do it in an original or groundbreaking way like lots of people would have you believe. The combat is almost exactly like DS1, and the bosses are an odd hybrid of styles and presentation from Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. The open world is lifeless and dull, and the game dumps needlessly obtuse exposition with no explanation of other parts of the lore or why you as the player should care. It's just ""go on a great quest, oh chosen Undead!"" Yeah, I haven't seen that anywhere else... except it's the premise for every FROM game since Dark Souls. Truly I am absolutely baffled as to how this game won any awards, much less Game of the Year. If you want a video game that you can install, have fun with, and put down until you wanna play again, this is NOT the game for you. If you like games where you have to sink an extreme amount of time and research into the world's lore, the broken combat system, and the general obtuse and bloated design of the game in hopes that you MIGHT be capable of squeezing out even the smallest crumbs of fun from it, then be my guest here. Hopefully I can at least get a refund so I can say I spent my money on a game I will actually play instead of a game that I boot up, play for 5 minutes, be reminded why I didn't buy at launch, die due to broken hit detection, and turn off again for 3 or 4 more weeks.
Maybe I'm old school, but I think video games should be fun right out of the box. Part of the reason I love PC gaming specifically is because there is so much variety to be had in terms of game experiences, whether in terms of ""pick up and play"" or ""big time sink"" type games like this one. And that is definitely not to say that all games that require you to put time and research into them are bad; some of my favorite games are Stalker, Silent Hill, and Disco Elysium, all games that require you to retain and put effort into the world and just being in the game. But this game, to me, epitomizes the soulless AAA product machine that gaming has become. ""Explore the open world!"" Why? Is there anything worth seeing there? Is there a good story? Or does everything in this game ultimately serve as just fluff in between hours of grinding that you're expected to just enjoy without any clear motivation as to why you should be enjoying it? And even then, when the story DOES show up, it's the exact same pseudo-verbose fake Tolkien crap FROM has been spoon-feeding their blood-loyal fans since Dark Souls. 
Seriously, if you want to waste your time ""getting gud"" at a broken ass game, at least do it with Bloodborne. You'd be doing yourself a service to save up the money to buy a PS4 just to buy Bloodborne over playing this one.

Overall the game is tedious, boring and random, with brief conversations and minimal NPC interaction (even when you confront important characters), just kill everything and get the loot... because everything wants to kill you... because.

Quests are all over the place with no way of tracking and by the time you find another NPC or a hint you don't even remember what you were working towards and you don't care. you can fight a boss or jump through hoops to complete an area just to get an item that is useless. main items are hidden away in places you overlooked with no good reason and no way of you knowing that.

7158,132380036,"I will rate it 8/10 (more on this below)

This game is purely designed for a true rpg experience i.e there would be no guidance or linear lore progression. You can go anywhere you wish but you will have to figure things on your own. To some people its exactly what they want, and for some it would be a terrible experience.

Things you will experience: -
1) Beautiful Landscapes
2) Sense of true exploration
3) Frustration (because the game is designed to be hard and is unforgiving, but you will get used to it).
4) Epic feeling/sense of accomplishment once you beat a certain boss.
5) Little to no happiness, dark world.

Things elden ring need to have for me to give it 10/10

1) Easy mode - It enables casual gamers to have a lore experience and not grind for an hour to learn boss patterns to beat them, it might be something a souls fan would love but a casual gamer is not looking to experience that. They just want to experience the art of the game and lore.

2) Game mechanics/rules need to be fair for everyone in the game - For eg In elden ring you cannot cancel your animation, but some bosses do not respect it. (Malenia) and every spell should have some cooldown to it to prevent npc from constantly spamming it due to error in programming.

3) A guide (Yes a guide) - As mentioned in point 1, the majority of gamers play games casually. So a guide system would be helpful (something like questhelper from World of Warcraft). It can try to guide a player for a more linear progression.

4) Option to re-fight a boss - Personally when I finished the game, I wanted to fight certain bosses because those were fun. But unfortunately you cannot and the only option is the new game+, I don't feel like doing the same again just to fight bosses. Especially when I have already finished 100% of the game. There is no incentive in doing so when you have already explored the whole game.

5) True coop: I don't know how can such a beautiful game have such a bad co-op experience, it has been solved upto some extend by modding community when they created ""Seamless co-op"". But true co-op in elden ring would have made it 100x better in my opinion.

7212,132363919,"This is legit the BIGGEST open world game I have ever played in my life. The sheer detailing of every region be it the art direction , enemy variety , level design , ambience & music is pure exquisite craftmanship  from the developers. Despite the open world design & approach borrowing it's idea from ZELDA , Elden Ring absolutely takes it to another level making it an experience unlike any other game I have played. The game is bigger than anybody can fathom. At times it could be quite overwhelming to keep track of the regions you have discovered, the NPC interactions and the constant breaking of questlines but it's quite unique on how the game doesn't dump details at your face and rather rewards you for exploration and discovery with it's rich and mysterious lore. I also think this is by far the most accessible FROM SOFTWARE game mainly because of the amount of choices you are left with to approach the game. The game play and combat though is detailed & vast doesn't necessarily have the learning curve complexity of their PREVIOUS game SEKIRO. Some of the biggest issues I had with the game are the poor optimisation for PC performance despite a locked 60 fps even in my 3060 GPU. Most of the Dragon battles I faced had extreme stuttering in terms of performance. Also there are some questionable design choices in the UI , for instance every time the game has a popup window in the middle of a battle when I resummon Torrent after he is dead. I get the need of it in the initial stages of the game but why does it continue till the very end. It's very much distracting and can quite lead you to your death at times. At least they should have included an option to turn it off in the settings. Also for a game with it's absolutely incredible number of bosses , the biggest enemy you will ever face is going to be the CAMERA. As the POPULAR saying goes : "" YOU CAN ESCAPE THE BOSSES , BUT NEVER THE CAMERA ""

7271,132352332,"Boy oh boy, this game is nothing less than great. Not only is this game cinematic the combat is fun the difficulty although at times can be a bit unfair is rather enjoyable, Being my first souls game I enjoy the experience a lot. Given that the game is cinematic which already makes an open-world game fun to explore, the music and looks tell you everything about the area. An example of this would be both the Leyndell Sewers and Caelid both of those areas feel uninviting as if you aren't supposed to be there. To be honest you probably aren't wanted there of the things that lurk in those places but that's what I love about the game the music, and the view all tell the same story of what's going on it, The game crafts and blends it all together beautifully. For the most part, all the bosses are fun, there are a couple of mini-bosses I dislike a lot and someone of them even required me to do some of those annoying ones for the completion of some character storylines, ( and a couple of boss fights that are required for the main story to progress that is horrible if you aren't prepared ). The game feels very rewarding for going out of your way to find things, and fighting the boss fights makes me feel like a badass when I finally manage to win. The story in Elden Ring also was amazing, a lot of people may say Elden Ring has no story, but that isn't the case it just has a different variation of storytelling. Such as Frenzy Flame (which the story starts at the very beginning of the game) or the story about the Lord of Blood (which is also something you'll likely run into). These little aspects affect the entire story and the more you learn about it the greater the connection grows with characters and the more it will hurt when some of said characters die. Elden Ring is truly a great game, regardless you mean the lore of a boss that you fought previously or a battle that you prepared for hours in advance. I personally felt a drive to win against those bosses as I imagined a world where they won and they succeeded. I would say this game is worth buying even at full price, but I wouldn't blame you for waiting for a sale.",2023-02-07 04:58:51,True,2,0,True,False,222,11,5137,0,5137,2023-02-07 02:27:52,406,0.9495,positive,4 stars,0.4763330280780792

7315,132344667,"Hands down, undoubtedly the game of the year. The sheer scope and grandeur of the game, along with its sense of exploration and wonder are just simply unmatched - among the very best that games have to offer.

It plays as a truly great game for the first 2/3rds of a typical playthrough. After which, I am dumbfounded by how sharp the drop-off is. How can a game provide 40 hours of near-perfect experience, and be tarnished by 20 hours of uninspired and truly baffling decisions at the end? From poor use of repeated content, and poor late-game balancing, to truly boring and at times truly unfair late-game bosses. It's frustrating how sullied my experience is with the game because of how padded and unnecessary certain sections and bosses during the late game were. (Youtube video essays such as Joseph Anderson, VG Matthew, and NeverKnowsBest's do a great job detailing these more than any review you will see here)

This game is well worth playing, it's an experience that almost universally - is agreed upon as near perfect at least until the late game. However, the joy of finishing the game is simply not there for me. I didn't feel that sense of triumph in overcoming adversity and culminating in a fitting end to the story - instead, I am simply glad that it is over.

Along with BoTW, this has shown me what a truly great game is like - at least in some aspects. I am glad that this game has inspired me to get into playing more singleplayer games where competitiveness is not the be-all and end-all. 10/10",2023-02-07 01:08:25,True,0,0,False,False,110,2,6045,0,4675,2023-02-13 19:02:47,271,0.9937,positive,2 stars,0.5571489731470743

Happens to me on every graphics settings. Consistent frames at my capped rate of 130 other than that. (lowering grass from max to high makes gave me 10-20 fps). 

There also seems to be some kb/mouse input problems with attacks not registering, etc. Probably has to do with it being made for controllers and might even be because of the higher framerates.

7349,132338618,"I've had an off on again relationship with fromsoft games.
I absolutely loved Dark Souls in 2011 and i have played nearly all there titles.
The problem is my tolerance for these sorts of games seemed to have diminished over the years as life can be stressful as it is without enduring that stress through my favourite pastime (Gaming)
BUT here's the thing that elevates Elden RIng to be my favourite Fromsoft game....this is finally accessible to all levels of gamer.

The game is accessible for a variety of reasons, the Open World allows you too play at your own pace levelling up as you do but the main reason (and it really is a game changer) is there is now summoning posts outside every boss fight and most locations. This means you can obtain help from another player if (Much more likely when) you get stuck.
This is a genius move that now enables this to be enjoyed by everyone rather then the hardcore end of the market.

The game isn't perfect, You can't pause the game which can be a real headache, the camera angle can be a pain and your steed's jumping (Seems to be a slight button delay) can cause a bit of frustration but the word frustrating isn't what i would describe this game which is a first for me when referring to fromsoft games. The vast open world with its unique, varied and vast locations truly outweigh any small negatives anyway
This also contains some of the best character design in any media!

7351,132338232,"Before Elden Ring, I had never played a From game before. But I was intrigued by all Elden Ring’s 10/10 ratings and the comparisons to Breath of the Wild, one of my favorite games.

This is a review for people like me, who are intimidated by the reputation for difficulty but are still willing to consider it because of all those stellar ratings.

OVERVIEW

The plot, such as it is, is Lord of the Rings, except you want to seize the One Ring for yourself so you can conquer Middle-EarthTheLands Between. In typical video game fashion, the ring has been split into multiple pieces and you have to find and murder the owners of each piece.

From a gameplay perspective, this means you explore ruins and dungeons, kill enemies, get better equipment and magic, level up, and repeat many times. There’s no other plot to speak of. NPC’s exist, but they mostly spout obscure and unintelligible gibberish.

Developer From Software is infamous for offering only Hard Mode with no lower difficulty or accessibility options, and they did the same here. If you like to play on Story Mode, find Normal Mode in other games very challenging, or need accessibility settings beyond controller remapping, From Software doesn’t want your business and you can stop reading now.

THE INTRO

This is not a noob-friendly game, starting with character creation. You start with a class selector, with eight different class options. Each class has a bunch of numbers and symbols, but there’s no explanation of what any of those symbols mean or what abilities that class has. 

Then you pick a starting “boon”, from about fifteen options. What does this do? Is it important? Also no explanation.

The combat tutorial is a brazen “fuck you” to noobs, because they stick it off the side where you can easily just walk right past it, and even when you go through it it barely explains how any of the systems work.

After the tutorial, same story. As you gain power, you pick stats to level up and pick weapons and equipment. When you do this, Elden Ring’s developers give you a stats screen full of tiny, barely-legible numbers.

Fortunately, my husband is a Dark Souls fan who had already played the game. He helped me pick a class, pointed out the tutorial that I wandered past, explained how blocking works, pointed out more stuff when it was clear I didn’t understand some system, and gave me pointers on how to pick stats to level up.

Having someone to help was absolutely essential. Without my husband’s advice, I would have given up in frustration within the first two hours.

THE GOOD PARTS. THEY’RE REALLY GOOD

Once past that initial hurdle, things got a lot better.

The world design is S-tier. You walk (or ride) around, and look at the environment, and you can be sure that no matter which direction you go you will find something. Quest markers and checklists are nonexistent. Points of interest are common and clearly telegraphed, while the path to get there is not always obvious, so you have to look around and figure out what to do.

No matter what the point of interest is, what you find there will almost always be combat.

Combat being the only objective sounds like it would be repetitive, but it isn’t.  By varying the size and shape of battle arenas and the types of enemy groupings, Elden Ring makes encounters become completely different even when facing enemies you’ve seen many times before.

Elden Ring keeps this variety up for the whole game, which is truly remarkable for how big it is.

Unfortunately, the game doesn’t have much to find that’s not combat. You’d expect that in a hundred-hour game they would liven things up a bit, but there are no towns, no puzzle shrines, no suspiciously placed rocks that hide collectibles, few platforming challenges, and no hidden paths to jawdropping views. Even so, the content that does exist is pretty great.

BUT IS IT TOO HARD?

Well, no and yes. And ultimately, yes.

It took a few hours to get the basics down, including some advice from my husband. After that, I would characterize it as “challenging but fair”. Even regular mobs deal a lot of damage and you have a very limited supply of healing potions. Traps and ambushes are common.

But it will normally not take you more than a few tries to take out a group of regular enemies, and if it’s too hard you can just move on and come back to slaughter them later. At least for a while.

The bosses are a different story. The boss difficulty is not reliably matched to the difficulty of the dungeon it’s in. Sometimes the bosses are easily dispatched, but often they are absurdly, unfairly difficult. The game seems to be expecting you to try bosses dozens of times before you win.

Many games have implemented this sort of challenge design well, but Elden Ring isn’t one of them. Instead of instantly respawning you near where you failed, the game routinely sticks respawn points several rooms away from the boss chamber, the battles are long with no mid-battle checkpoints, and the death animations and load times are glacial.

I started timing one these battles, and found that for every twenty seconds of fighting the boss, I spent twenty-eight seconds on death animations and loading screens, and another fifty on walking from the respawn point back to the boss chamber. What a waste of time.

Eventually, I gave up on even trying to fight the bosses. Instead, I would clear the rest of the dungeon, unlock the boss chamber, and come back fifteen or twenty hours later to fight the boss. Occasionally, this resulted in a truly epic battle where I survived with a sliver of health. Sometimes, it was a tough but fair challenge. But it most often resulted in a pushover.

Then I got near the endgame (I think), and the game collapsed. I had done every bit of content I could find, and no matter where I went everything was too hard. The five headed dragon guarding the fourth shard? The remaining optional overworld bosses I had skipped?. The optional minidungeon I had skipped? The next legacy dungeon blocking the critical path? Everything was too hard, in every direction.

That was when I gave up, over a hundred hours in.

I probably *could* have cleared it by playing the game’s way, trying each challenge dozens of times, spending the majority of my playtime on loading screens and walking from respawn points to bosses and tough enemies. Or I could have embraced the fact that this is technically a JRPG and ground mobs for hours until I got another twenty  levels. But why? That’s not fun.

BUY OR NO BUY?

Overall, Elden Ring was a bizarre mix of really spectacular top-tier content and frustrating bullshit. This world design is everything I’ve wanted from an open world, so much better than other titles, and the combat is often fair and well-designed.

But the hostility to players who don’t already understand the systems and a terribly implemented “try over and over until you get it right” approach to boss design are really bad.

So should you play it? Well, if

you can mitigate the atrocious load times because you have a current-gen console or high-specs PC. Statistically, you probably don’t, but maybe you do.

You have a friend who already played the game and is willing to advise you.

You’re ok with giving up and not finishing the game.

If you have all this stuff, go for it. Otherwise, skip.

Final rating: 1/10. I feel weird giving a game I spent a hundred hours on such a poor review, but “it was eventually so frustrating I gave up” loses a lot of points. I am biased and copy pasted this review aint no way you read all this just buy this game since its the best thing you will prob do in your entire existence!",2023-02-06 22:10:05,True,1,1,True,False,22,9,5818,0,5805,2023-02-06 23:08:09,1342,-0.9984,negative,4 stars,0.5424881093204021

7382,132334111,"This is literally one of the greatest games I have ever played. Is it perfect? God no. There are plenty of things holding it back from being perfect.

And yet, Elden RIng is still a masterpiece. An awe-inspiring soundtrack, a map of incredible scope, and enough varied and unique encounters to fill up that map to the point that I can still pinpoint the location of wolves in Limgrave. Ridiculous levels of build variety allows for a great deal of replayability. A large cast of unique bosses, many of which have a mountain of buildup that, if you are paying attention, makes you feel like you are facing off against Gods and Titans that should be revered rather than slaughtered. 

And, my personal favorite part of all this, Elden Ring is jam-packed with lore. There are ancient civilizations, long-lost deities, body-snatching demons, eldritch horrors, and yet the most pertinent questions that have rattled around in my head for the past year since the game launched pertains to the very characters that you can talk to in-game. If you are willing to sink in the time, you will realize that significant parts of the story do not add up, but hint at secrets to be solved.

I can see other players complaining of the game being to difficult but it’s all about learning the moves sets, finding your play style, and what makes u more powerful, also this is my first time playing a souls game.

7396,132330409,"Absolutely phenomenal.

The craftsmanship that went into this game is well worth the awards it has received to date.

Being a Dark Souls fanboy since the Prepare to Die edition, till now, I got to hand it to them.
This is their biggest creation yet in all aspects.

I still remember fondly the greatness that DS1 was, and the challenges with the bad porting and mods we had to go through. Lovely years to say the least.

If this is the direction their next games will be taking, I will be a constant ""subscriber"". 

Marvelous storytelling even for a small patch of land, classically needing to read item descriptions, pay attention to structures and beings, and make connections between them to figure out stories.

Game-play can be as unforgiving as you desire it to be. The art is phenomenal in every aspect, the combat more enjoyable that what I was expecting when I went into the game for the first time. The world is massive and a real treat. 

The music OST is outstanding as well, chill-inducing you'd say.

Really looking forward to it's DLC(s).

Only negative issue so far, is some random game crashes when it concerns multiplayer, whether it's Colosseum or invasions (on RTX 3080ti, NVm2, 32GB DDR5, I7-12700).

7431,132321279,"First off, let me be clear by saying this game is absolutely phenomenal. If you have a really beefy computer. I can tell this is a game that would be one of my favorites of all time, due to some areas being less demanding and running well. 

If you're like me and you have a computer only slightly above minimum requirements listed on steam, do not expect to have a good time. If there was a mixed option, I'd pick it, but there isn't so I can't. 

This game barely runs at 720p on the lowest settings at an acceptable FPS, and often it will decide to stutter like crazy in some areas, many of those areas coming after you're likely to be eligible for a refund. There are many areas where the instant I walk into it my FPS dips below 10 and stays there, which makes the game run in slow motion. I have tried to the best of my ability to play through it, but I just can't in good faith recommend this to anyone on the fence about if their computer can handle it. I have not had performance nearly this bad in any other Fromsoft game. The minimum performance specs listed below are a lie and in reality you want a computer much better than that for it to run acceptably.

They really need to do better on these ports or at least list their specs more accurately.

EDIT: I managed to get more reliable and acceptable performance by editing my registry to boost the game's CPU priority. This is still a negative review since you should not have to mess with your registry to change CPU priority. Lmao. 
After having beaten the game due to being able to not play in a world of slowed time, I can really say this game is incredible, though, so take this review as a recommendation if your computer is significantly better than minimum specs.

That being said, I really hope PC ports of this quality aren't reoccurring trends for Fromsoft.",2023-02-06 15:38:51,False,1,0,True,False,223,29,5769,98,4299,2023-02-26 07:16:17,343,0.9915,positive,2 stars,0.4176114797592163

7433,132321025,"Not worth the frustration. Devs are way too reliant on stun locking as ""difficulty"", enemies always scale to kill you in 2-3 attacks in each new zone and basically cheat, i.e. attacks going through terrain / walls, attacks that have large arcs or invisible areas of effect that don't require actual contact with your model, crappy camera and targeting exploited with cheap one shots, attacks that can't be blocked / parried, etc.. For all the people talking about how this game needs so much skill, they sure seem to miss the point where you don't need skill, it's 100% pattern recognition, and most of the videos you see about this game are meme builds or exploits that avoid the combat the game is somehow praised for. So many assets are re-used that if you can clear the first zone, you'll be set for 95% of the rest of the game. I'm so sick of fighting dragons I just roll my eyes when I see them now.

And then there are bugs. Quest lines can break because you teleported into a place, some NPCs don't appear because you *didn't* teleport into a place, quests that don't begin until you talk to a random NPC on the other side of a map with no indication they would know anything about it.

7449,132315990,"I've been playing HARD games since the Atari 2600, and did enjoy my time with Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1/2.

(If you follow a walk-through, disregard my review as you might like the game, being told how to get OP at the start and cruise through the confusing mess that this game suggests you follow and go to completely random points that someone without a guide has no idea about.  

But, me, myself buy games to play and explore, I like to complete games myself which is the complete opposite of what Elden Ring REQUIRES)

Elden ring is a joyless exercise in seeing how much you can take before just giving up.  I'm not talking about the combat, I'm talking about the 'apparent' GOLDEN PATH with misleads you into thinking that's what you should be doing.  In-fact, you're better of riding your horse all around this depressing wasteland and collecting random items to make sure you don't go to the first GOLDEN PATH area and just get 1 shot over and over.

Even if you love Demon/Dark Souls, please I beg you, read some proper reviews and even look at the guides showing what a mess this game is.  This is worse than what we'd call a ""Nintendo Power Guide"" game back in the day...

So much of this game is just there to waste your time, or outright f**k you over, its not worth it.  I'll give one example;

You come to a Castle that is a complete abstraction of what a castle is, makes no sense, and multiple pathes require leaps of faith, lead nowhere, or you have to jump frokm ledge to ledge to get to different parts, But you are getting through it thinking, its confusing as crap and you have no idea where you are and its been a while since a reset point (Lost Grace or some dumb crap).  

You walk through a walled area, and you see a Knight you need to fight and know it'll be difficult, but then you swing the camera around and hidden behind a purposely obscured wall is ANOTHER KNIGHT waiting to blast you in the back...

This is a Soul-less game, its designed to be a Youtuber/Steamer/Follow our guide game...

Like all souls games, unless you have hundreds of hours to dedicate to get good at this game it will only frustrate casual players who only have a couple hours a week of gaming time because, you know... life...
additionally, though there is a large amount of lure in the game it does a horrific job at telling the story, finding quest givers and littered with translation errors that makes the lure even harder to understand. 
script was written in japanese and translated to english... very poorly. even Youtube creators will comment how difficult piecing the story together is. 
Furthermore, the game punishes you for playing multiplayer. the moment you enter or welcome a player to your game you are immediately open to invasions forcing you into unwanted pvp. LOTS of griefers in the starting area. don't play with friends if you're just a casual player or get the multiplayer mod (seemlesscoop) where you can play with friends and not deal with stupid unwanted pvp. some players are not into that and shouldn't be forced into it. the game has an arena for pvp, that should be enough...there is a play offline option but then you can't play co-op.  Thank god for modders fixing bad developer decisions.  games like these are always funner playing with friends, why the devs decided to punish you for it is something I will never understand. 
another issue is that if you've never played a souls game before be prepared for extreme lack of instruction. there is a small tutorial that shows you how to swing your weapon and move around... aside from that, good luck, figure it out, you're on your own...

7506,132301792,"Game of the Year 2022. it deserves its recognition. 
I have played every Fromsoft game at this point, and i can confidently say that i think that 'on average' this is by far the best game they have ever made. i say that because i would say that many of their titles seem to excel in 1 subject specifically as compared to Elden Ring.

i would say that;
 -Dark Souls 1 has still the best Replayability,
 -Bloodborne still captures the audience harder with its Gothic/Lovecraftian theme, setting, and narrative. 
 -Dark Souls 3 Contends a better Co-op experience, and an almost universally better PVP experience. 
 -Sekiro has a much more 'perfected' Gameplay (with a sheer lack in Variety due to lack of weapons)

that being said, if all of these other titles are a 10/10 in thier specific catagory of what they did right, the rest of the game doesnt add up to what Elden Ring has done. Elden Ring has made it so that every thing they did was a 8-9.5/10 so every thing about this game, is at least great, if not perfect. and then the sheer quantity of content in this Game easily dwarfs most of the other titles by a landslide. why Liurnia, Elden Rings 3rd Zone, which is only about 12% of its map. is aruably the same size as all of Dark Souls 1.

so to summarize. Elden ring isnt necessarily the best in very aspect compared to previous From Titles, i would however say that it is at least the 2nd best at everything those previous ones excelled at. and they delivered everything together is such sheer quality, and Quantity, that this is essentially one of the best games that I personally have ever played.

So all in all, I'd give Elden Ring (Pre-DLC) a 9.7/10",2023-02-06 05:17:22,True,0,0,True,False,52,4,32988,830,28486,2023-03-05 09:48:12,302,0.9911,positive,5 stars,0.5608399957418442

7529,132298934,"Game difficulty is set to lethal from the start which makes it hard and frustrating to learn, being one shot in the tutorial by a psuedo-boss at the end is saying something.  The game's design is very unusual as it shows a level of focus on killing the player that I have not experienced in other games, something that is apparent with the very high death count I've accrued.  

I quantify my appreciation for this game in comparing it to Witcher 3, a game I played up to the hardest setting 'Death March' and logged over 1000 hrs.  In the first 30 minutes of Witcher 3 I found the game to be fun, interesting, and wishing to play more.  In the first 30 minutes of Elden Ring I found myself asking how is it I avoid dying in combat to exacting parry timers, advanced enemy AI, and vague scaling in enemy strength.  

At this point I've cleared the Tree Sentinel and three minor bosses in caves, in lieu of satisfaction of achievement it's just the relief of one less thing trying to chase me down and kill me.  The encumbering system of relying on potions to recover and hoping to find the next respawn point mirrors the relief as treading water is a reality because everything respawns if you rest to refill the potions which can place a drag on progress.  I am skeptical that I will finish the game with the trend it carries on with.

I would say this game appeals to people who enjoy balancing on the edge of a knife, because it doesn't seem meant for the average gamer.

7627,132282024,"Positive just because I really like the visuals.

With respect to everyone who adore this game, I find it to be nothing special. Actually it is bit boring for me. For people who really want to go in to long term development of their character, love to micro manage all the percentages, it can be fun. But basically it is just kill, get stronger so you can kill more. If it wasn't for very unique visuals and characters I would abandon this game long ago. In relation to character I know game wanted to go for a very unique feel but every character sounds like they have a severe iron deficiency.

Lore is unique but individual stories in the game are nothing new. I've been gaming for a long time and have seen similar stories, and have seen better stories. (PS I have just 33 hours in game but have seen a lot of videos about it).

To best explain Elden Ring it is like making a castle out of cards. it will take skill, time, sweat and tears but at the end of the day, not really worth it.

Elden Ring is like this post, TLDR. Except for some people. 

If I have to give points, this game would get 5/10.

7667,132274127,first let me start by saying this game is one of the best games i have ever played. the sense of discovery is unbelievable. you can see a lot of inspiration from breath of the wild and i was a massive fan of that game as well. i tend to juggle games but all i want to play is Elden Ring. the art direction and beauty is jaw dropping.  i am only 50ish hours in and just started scratching the surface of this massive open world game. elden ring plays very well on the steam deck and that's how i have been spending most of my time in this world. i love the fact the Fromsoft made this game very accessible without turning the difficulty down. this is still very much a souls game just very defined with elements of all there games stacked in this one game. you can see the talents from this company getting better and better with every entry. fighting the bosses have never been better without the losers walk of shame back to the boss arena. this alone has made this souls game a lot more accessible and more enjoyable in my opinion. i personally don't write reviews and this is my first one on steam but think this game is so good that it deserves one. if i can talk just one person into getting this game i would be happy as Godrick taking a axe to the arm.   no matter how many reviews you may read and watch there are still big suprises around every corner. stumbling upon a cave when you think you have checked every nook and cranny is a  incredible feeling just to make you mind race with what could possibly be in there. i know i am all over the place and doing nothing but gushing but this game truly is that good and that incredible. if Elden Ring is this good then i can only imagine how flushed out there next game will be. i can see why this is game of the year and maybe even game of the decade.,2023-02-05 18:47:46,True,0,0,True,False,49,1,4576,841,3155,2023-03-06 21:36:01,353,0.9969,positive,5 stars,0.6932012885808945

7674,132271319,"As with any game with a dodge-roll, there's only two ways to make it difficult; adding jank or forcing the player to avoid multiple attacks at once. Elden Ring goes for the former, adding start-up frames to your dodge roll and large, lingering hitboxes for enemy attacks. There's a large amount of recycled content, hitbox issues when using small weapons, and rather linear progression despite trying to be an open-world. My final issue is that because FromSoftware is always trying to one-up the difficulty of the game, bosses end up having infinitely extendable combos, punishing you for trying to learn a boss and squeeze as many hits out as possible. This issue is only exacerbated by certain near-undodgeable attacks, such as Margit's/Morgott's triple swing, Godrick's wind gust start-up, and Radagon's elden shattering.",2023-02-05 18:00:08,False,2,0,True,False,48,6,5012,0,5012,2023-01-30 05:06:50,132,-0.9709,negative,3 stars,0.37211863696575165

7735,132257447,"Elden Ring is the first first souls/souls-like game I have ever played and it does not leave a good impression on the genre and the team at From Software. For a game released in 2022 It is about 10 years behind what would be expected for this era of gaming. Firstly this game is capped at 60 fps which is a sheer let down, even new gen consoles can run at 120+ fps so they had literally no excuse. Even the PC community was able to fix this within a few days of release so it cant of been that hard for a AAA gaming studio. (using the communities fix removes all online features which is why I did not use it). Furthermore the PC port for Elden Ring is terrible, controls are clunky and clearly designed for controllers, fortunately you can rebind right, well yes you can but From Software managed to fuck this up as well leaving PC players with minimal options compared to other games. If any other AAA game was released in this state they would be ridiculed beyond belief by the community. In conclusion the technical aspects of this game are severely dated for this generation of gaming and there is no one else to blame but the team at From Software and their incompetence to produce a game even mildly up to standard with the times.",2023-02-05 14:15:47,False,1,0,False,False,34,3,2497,0,2266,2023-02-15 10:21:17,232,-0.9657,negative,2 stars,0.4699455300966899

They stuffed ambush, mini-boss fights, and all sorts of shenangians in every corner of the map. Whenever you feel like exploring, you just end up dying from unnecessary surprises. The devs want you to die every five minutes or so. Oh, look what a nice view over there, let's go check it out. Whoops, a crucible knight jumps out of nowhere and obliterates you.

I am not whining because I couldn't beat them. I destroyed every one of them, even the disgustingly crazy Goddess of Rot fight. Check my achievements if you don't believe me. Those fights aren't enjoyable and you just want to get it over worth as soon as possible.

After that most of the content was very well designed & scaled. Of course there are some things which are doable solo but somethings like the Godskin Duo i would recommend doing with an Ash or another player.

7788,132243756,"Before starting the actual review, huge thanks to [b]director: Hidetaka Miyazaki[/b], [b]writer: George R. R. Martin[/b] and last but not least the [b]development team: FromSoftware[/b] for creating this beautiful and still ""git gud"" challenging video game for us to enjoy.

Also congratulation for winning the [b]The Game Awards 2022 - Game of the Year[/b] and the [b]Steam Awards 2022 - Game of the Year[/b] trophies at least (on top of the bunch of other awards).

TL;DR If you have liked the previous Dark Souls games or looking for real challenge from a action RPG genre, you just don't have any excuses for NOT to playing the [b]ELDEN RING[/b]. [b][u]It's that awesome and worth of every single coin you put into it.[/u][/b]

For those who haven't tried out any of previous Dark Souls related games, I really recommend you to give it a try. Like previous games Elden Ring gives you life lessons of not giving up when you face the impossible obstacle, there is always solution to get pass that, even if it means making decisions that are not easy.

Started playing with Intel i7-8700K & RTX 3080 -> a bit over middle way through upgraded to AMD 7600X & RTX 3080.

This review is written in POV of character with following setup (can contain spoilers);

[spoiler]Magic caster (lvl 165 50,50,30,13,13,70,8,10), no summons & spirit/war ashes used, no parrying, no great runes activated, no PVP, Malenia and every other boss beaten in single playthrough, zero respeccing, zero guides watched.[/spoiler]


[h2][b]Story & Graphics and Environment[/b][/h2]
Following the similar path as the previous [b]FromSoftware[/b] games, the [b]Elden Ring[/b] moves story forward via cutscenes and having conversations with NPC's. You won't get every necessary detail right away, but inspecting the environment, NPC's told stories and item texts, give you at least some knowledge of this vast, mystic and gruesome story and game lore.

To get the whole picture, I recommend watching an video from YouTube after finishing the game. I will guarantee you'll be shocked to find some of the NPC lore and backgrounds later.

The game doesn't include a ""Quest-tracker"" itself, but some guidance is provided by the map. This means you might accidentally skip some ""cool side-quests"". To those who really want to see every bit of story, I recommend following community tools like Wiki or YT videos.

Once opening the first doors, you'll be welcomed to the 'the Lands Between'. The visuals and environment almost made me cry, for just being alive to experience this kind of magnificent graphical output. It's just so life-like and unreal at the same time.
Being playing at the same time couple other open-world RPG games but their visual output isn’t even near what [b]Elden Ring[/b] is able to produce.

Few YT channel recommendations (not all Lore related): [url=https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya/videos]VaatiVidya[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxgcx0CKkjo9lE40sUdRjhTHfF6XORub]Zullie the Witch[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/@ymfah/videos]ymfah[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/@Fextralife/playlists]Fextralife[/url].  


[h2][b]Gameplay[/b][/h2]

What can I say, the 'git gud' mentality will get you eventually. The game sets quite early that world isn't fair for you. You'll encounter many enemies and bosses with different movement, attack patterns alike, which some may be easy for your current build. Eventually you'll face the most absurd obstacle where it can get frustrated to continue. But be smart, learn from your mistakes and change/upgrade few things and brake through like a wrecking ball. 

Movement was the very key of my playthrough, and the Light/Medium armor sets felt at the end the best option.
There is definitely better ways to play out than my way, but after unlocking certain ""mixture"", magic felt overpowered as I was able to Kamehame-haa the bosses straight to face and beat it under 10 seconds (this said thou I was also in some cases way above the enemies or the area level itself).

Guarantee there is some even brain dead builds available on lower level to beat every boss of the game but that is the main aspect of the gameplay itself. You have the vast variety of options to move, attack, defend and ease the gameplay to the max if necessary.

This is also the thing I'd like to see in other open-world RPG genre games in the future. [b]*Cough*, other AAA-game studios, please other take notes and put them into your games, but not behind a paywall.. Thank you.[/b]


[h2][b]Soundtrack[/b][/h2]

Once you start the game, your ears are going to bleed of liquefied diamonds. It is like a another dimension gods were living just to place every track preciously to time freeze bubble, so once you step inside of it. You're the one who lives the moment of an epic tale of the game.

Soundtrack is an masterpiece of an composer work from [b]Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Tai Tomisawa, Yuka Kitamura, and Yoshimi Kudo[/b] and the orchestra work from The Budapest Film Orchestra.
Do check out the [url=https://bandainamco.lnk.to/Elden_Ring_ST]Official Soundtrack[/url] even if you haven't purchased the game yet.

I might be total garbage at Elden Ring but even if you can't beat a boss by skill you can always just farm and comeback a mega-hulk and do 50% of their health bar per hit. which some will say takes away from the FromSoft experience but I think it makes this game more accessible to a wider audience.

7932,132221042,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

You may look at this games graphics and think its from 2016 or something but when you start playing it instantly encapsulates you and feels a lot better than most of the newer games. Art style and ambiance is fascinating. I regularly find myself just running around and viewing the beatiful scenery without doing anything else. It shows that artists are really the masters of their craft. I also love how fromsoft use music in their games. Its really something magical. Combat is super fluid and satisfying. Open world is amazing, exploring is extremely enjoyable. Weapon variety, ashes of war and sheer number of skills you can get makes the character customization a lot deeper than other fromsoft games and its really fun to try different things on the run. While its probably not so optimal, if you are just exploring every little nook and cranny you'll probably over-level and faceroll the bosses anyway so dont shy and try different things!

7991,132211528,"Tato hra je totální master piece

Elden ring byla má první hra od vývojářského studia From Software a musím říct, že na mě studio udělalo obrovský dojem a hry od něj budu hrát i nadále. Ale co podle mě Elden Ring udělalo natolik úžasným?

World:
Postupné objevování světa je skvělé a až na výjimky se už od začátku můžeme dostat kamkoliv, což ve hrách vždy rád vidím, ale v Elden Ringu mě to potěšilo ještě více svojí různorodostí, až už travnatý a hornatý Lim Grave, pustý a děsivý Caelid, jezernatá Liurnia či jednoduše nádherná Siofra. Všechno to jsou opravdu krásně vybudované a obsahem narvané lokace ,u kterých se vám oči ani prsty nudit nebudou. Každá nabízí své unikátní nepřátele i atmosféru, která by se dala krájet. Jak rád bych opět zažil ten pocit co jsem měl při prvním spuštění. Ten pocit po touze objevovat a prozkoumat ten svět, který se předemnou právě otevřel do posledního koutku. A že má co nabídnout. I po spuštění NG+ se mi podařilo najít lokace o jejichž existenci jsem do teď neměl ani páru.
K lokacím mám jen jednu jedinou výtku a to směrem k Weeping Peninsula, která toho dle mého nemá zas tolik co nabídnout, ale zase nechci říkat, že by se jednalo o něco špatného.

Gameplay:
Postava je krásně responzivní, reaguje přesně jak klikám a ani jednou se mi nestalo, že by opravdu dělal něco co sem nechtěl. U každého špatného rollu jsem věděl, že je to má chyba, stejně tak u každého pádu při platformové pasáži. Možná ovládání Torrenta je trochu prkené. Ovládání v soubojích je jednoduché na pochopení, příjemné a na ovládání. Ještě bych chtěl vypíchnout jak hra přistupuje k questům. Žádně question marky, které mi ukazují kam mám jít. Nic takového v Elden Ringu nenajdete. Sice možná některé questy budete procházet dle návodů na Wiki/YTB, ale to mi vůbec nevadilo. Naopak mě to těšilo tím jak hra není zbytečně zahlcená a není tam nic zbytečně navíc. Dále bych chtěl zmínit summons, kterých je ve hře opravdu dost. Postupem času odemykáte lepší. Summons můžete získat u traderů nebo z bossů. Které si pak vylepšujete stejně jako zbraně.

Příběh:
Osobně bych řekl, že studiem loru jsem strávil ještě víc času než na hře samotné. Propracovaná historie a malinkaté detaily, které ho doplňují, mě uchvátili více jak jakákoliv fantasy kniha či film co jsem kdy viděl. George Raymond Richard Martin odvedl při tvorbě tohoto světa naprosto fenomenální práci. Dobrá práce Georgi

Finální verdikt:
I přes to, že bych o Elden Ringu byl schopen mluvit dlouhé hodiny, udělám to jak stručně jen můžu:

Solid game, just not my type. I don't really enjoy Souls-like games and I'm jealous of people who actually do. I get it, you try and try and try and kill the boss and that satisfaction is everything but to me it's not enough to beat all the frustration I have during playing the game.

The game itself is beautiful, great animations, bosses, creatures and the environment is stunning. The only thing that I didn't like is that character feels tooo slow most of the time, idk how to explain it. Feels like when I tap on my controller it has a delay and character does it after 1-2 seconds. Maybe it's supposed to be like that but made me frustrated.

If you love souls-like games you'll definitely enjoy this one, one of the best if not the best in it's genre. Who knows? Maybe I'll get back to it at some point but for now I just can't, I prefer to spend my time in something relaxing.",2023-02-04 15:31:01,True,0,0,True,False,55,40,741,0,741,2023-01-12 01:12:52,170,0.9599,positive,4 stars,0.5212847292423248

This is a very fun game when playing with the correct attitude. You die a lot, it's part of the game. You sacrifice your life to learn something new, you purposefully lose your runes during the next attempt at the boss so they don't distract you the next several attempts at beating it, you try, try, try again, then tweak setups before trying more.

8184,132166969,"My overall take:
Wow. Where to even start. This is the first souls game I have ever played. I come from playing games like Destiny 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Mass Effect, etc. Sometime the games being ""hard"". I did not know what hard was until I played this game. Nor have I ever had this much of challenge for a game. Other games are somewhat challenging, but this one tests your skills. Some of you will be slightly frustrated, some angry, and a select few give up the game when you keep trying to kill the sentinel at the starting area. But those who don't you will find yourself comparing other games to this game. Once you complete elden ring, every game you play after this will be a cake walk. This is a fantastic game. The world is so large with all sorts of enemies and items littered around the area. You actually have an incentive to explore in order to face the next boss. None of the quests are pointless skinned objectives. Every level up and item you get will bring you a step closer to becoming lord. 

Aspects: The parts that relieve you from the frustration is the messages on the ground. They can be helpful, but sometimes they can be funny and humorous. Read them when you have the chance. The number of main quests in this game aside from the linear story, are all meaningful and have purpose. The Items depending on your combat style will help you in your progress. Find Bell items to help get more items to level up your weapons. Explore the world. You spend plenty of time leveling up to get to the next boss. You might as well explore. 

The World:

This game shows that art style is supreme when presenting a game. It may not be bringing your console or pc to its knees because of its graphics, but it beautiful in its own unique way. There will be times you just stop to admire how beautiful the game is. The world is so big. I didn't realize there was an underground area until mid way through my playthrough. There is so much in this world. You can spend hundreds of hours and you will never see all of it. 

Combat:

Skill is everything. Be mindful and strategic. You can spam if you want but be strategic about it. Find the way you like to fight at the beginning of the game and not further in. I learned using a regular axe of the most the way until midway then I switched weapon type and took some time to learn. Long story short find the way you like to fight and stick with it, while improving your skills. 

End Review: 

I have never played a game that required this much skill. I was frustrated many times, but when you beat a boss it is so rewarding and feels great. I hope you all enjoy the journey to become the Elden Lord.",2023-02-04 06:09:29,True,0,0,True,False,172,67,3676,0,3676,2023-02-04 05:52:52,503,0.9948,positive,4 stars,0.5194390217463175

8188,132166090,"111 hours and I'm not recommending it. Good God.

Pros: Level design, character design, environment art, music: all of these are top-tier and will keep you going throughout a very long journey.

Cons: People confuse obfuscation with mystery and bad UX with challenge. To complete this game, you will have to consult a wiki. Not because it is hard (which it is) but because they do very little to tell you where your objectives are. Perhaps they expect you to endlessly wander around the world in hopes you bump into that NPC again. If they put them on the critical path line, maybe that would happen but it is often just in a random spot. That isn't serendipity; it's just being opaque. Maybe the nonsense story would make a bit of sense if information was organized or if there was a basic quest tracker. I don't need a bunch of UI elements to tell me exactly where something is, just try and respect the player a little bit. Did you know that you essentially have to upgrade HP more than any other stat or you will be one-shotted by nearly everything in the game? Would be nice to know, especially since you can only recast your stats halfway-ish through the game.

Speaking of respecting the player, if you are going to be tough as nails, you have to be spotlessly bug free. Unfortunately, attacks go through solid objects at random and frame drops will eat your lunch at the worst possible times. There's little joy when you eventually succeed; just relief that an annoying element is done. Luckily, you can often beat bosses by tricking the AI or leveraging a bug in the environment so I guess two can play at that game. 

And who decided that this game where the character rightly feels like he is wearing forty pounds of armor should be a platformer? 

I'm happy I roughed my way through it, but I can't see myself recommending it to anyone. It's an interesting game, but not what the incredibly toxic community exalts it as. It's a bleak game with a few truly exquisite moments outweighed by a preponderance of slog.

8200,132164582,"Elden Ring is a Challenging yet rewarding experience as you traverse through large open world landscapes permeating with enemies and bosses of all different shapes, sizes and attack styles. The game (much like the soulsbourne series in general) is an excellent personification of life itself. Focusing on a format where through your many struggles and setbacks, if you learn from your mistakes and persevere, you will prevail. Their are multiple different classes to choose that allow you to play the game how you see fit, so their is no right or wrong way to play and is purely up to player on how best to approach a situation and to embrace or strategise your strengths and weaknesses. The game is also very well polished (a rarity in modern gaming) with clear forethought in its design, very minimal bugs were present in my play through and the combat seems very well balanced. The story is conveyed mostly through lore, requiring the player to research the details of the characters and they're history, ambitions & goals to create a better understand of the world. Some may be disappointed in its lack of presence but personally this works in favour of the game, as its there if you are interested to learn, and if you're not then just carry on and it won't matter (Radahn has the best backstory btw). needless to say I adore Elden Ring and look forward to seeing more from Fromsoftware :)

tl;dr Overall Elden Ring is easily the best way to get into the Soulsbourne series of games, its challenging yet rewarding, has fairly balanced combat, the open world is mesmerising, extensive lore. their is lots to love about this game

Moving to an open world has absolutely killed all joy, all tension, all skill and hardship that defined the Souls series. I am completely alone in a bland, empty world with no noteworthy npcs, copy pasted dungeons, the ability to completely invalidate entire sections of the map by accidentally leveling up (you know, playing the game) or just spawning a summon that dumpsters any boss.  Open world worked in the Witcher because it had a story, and characters to make the world feel alive or at least give you a purpose for what you are doing.  Not to mention that it looked and played far better with better quality of life inclusions.  Riding a horse sucks, scanning the map so you don't miss important items or entire NPC questlines sucks.  Enemy design is a joke where they will literally have a seizure if you hit them too much.  You can't compare shop items to ones equipped because this game was apparently designed in 1997.  FromSoft tried to shove a square peg into a triangular hole and failed miserably.

8287,132151283,"I didn't play any of the souls games prior to this, but heard good reviews from this so tried it. And even in the first few minutes I got bored, the graphics felt cheap to me like pubg for some reason and the controls weird (Who jumps with F instead of space and selects OK with E and back with Q?). 

But as I played just 30 mins more the next day and faced my first boss it kicked off, I started to see what it was about. There is nothing more satisfying than failing a boss multiple times, getting stronger and more skilled and finally beating it after an hour. I saw the attention to detail in the story lines, the beauty of certain cut scenes and scenic points, and the sheer size of the map to explore. 

And don't forget the amount of freedom the game offers you. You can customise your character and it's combat style to the smallest detail. And it does not have to stay that way, I changed from a tank class to a sorcerer in just a matter of minutes because I enjoyed that style more. You are not constantly reminded of quests you accepted. So you have to remember which made me form a bond with those characters by making them the focus instead of just completing to get items. I've watched some of the lore people have got on youtube to expand my knowledge of this world even more. And the story has multiple endings (as I've heard) from the choices you make. An RPG in its truest essence.

8295,132150611,"This review is written from a (perspective) run I tried to do with a standard classic greatsword playthru with no summons, incarnation,passive buildups which open up my eyes on ER flaws a lot more: 


The Main Bosses aka the Legendary Bosses that you are required to beat are honestly not that fun or satisfying. 
It seem like they all share the same type of behaviour: 
-spam every attack possible with little to no cooldown in-between each attack and ability. 
-leave a 0.5 second window for the player to both react on and deal damage in
-Evade if the player is close to them for more then 2 seconds.
-have a back/tail attack if you manage to out-maneuver them and strike from behind.
-Still being able to instantly kill you even with 60+ Vigor. 

And even when you manage to outplay them they will find a way to punish you.
Out of all main bosses that I played against the only ones that was fun more me was Godfrey and Rykard. 
The mid to late game bosses are some of the most dull and annoying encounters as well:

Radahn: Honestly not the worst but just feel like a chore if anything.
Draconic Tree sentinel: I mean its already a tree sentinel reskin with just some added abilites that they spam even more with.
Morgott: Spam and very small attack windows if you try to avoid damage.
Fire giant: ridiculous large arena and tanky HP. You are not even fighting a boss, just its feet. 
God skin duo: Reskin fight of the Godskins noble but you have to fight 2 instead of just 1 and you need to kill both of them twice. 
Makelith. Spam.

There is to much waiting and too little combat cause of all the spam attacks and Evades. 
This also leaves a lot of weapon types unviable for PVE cause of how slow you attack with them. By the time you started your swing animation with something like a colossal sword the boss could already gotten 5 hits on you. 


I am not saying its impossible to beat them with standard ""balanced true-soul experience gameplay"" builds
But its not fun


Fromsoftware balanced the game way to much around co-op and arcane/int/ability builds it indirectly nerfed standard sword and no-abilites meele gameplay which is a bummer.

On my first playthrough all I used was a katana with bleed buildup and scarlet rot dragon ability and it was pretty much ggs.

+Game is still really fun
+there is so much to do
+Good replayability 
+Fun and intresting side quests as well side quest bosses
+tons of different builds and playstyles you can do and test out (even if some of them are straight up busted or really underwhelming without specific items) 

In the end of the day ER is primarily a RPG game so it make sense to a degree the way its balanced and designed

If you however want something that offer a more linear and rewarding basic melee gameplay you should probably look into DS3 or Sekiro.

8318,132146403,"It's an OK game but unfortunately I found it EXTREMELY grindy.
As a relative newbie to the souls games, having only played some early stages of Sekiro when visiting a friend, I didn't quite know what to expect. The online debate didn't miss me so the mantra of ""tough but fair"" was definitely familiar.
Bulletpoints:
- the combat is entertaining but unfortunately my reflexes aren't as sharp as they used to be so I can't say I found it particularly enjoyable. It ultimately relies way too much on grind to compensate for slower than average response times. While I understand the logic of git gud and I did invest a lot of time into the game in the end the mechanic of farming plebs for level up points un-engaging. Even if I ultimately bailed, the purist are right about no difficulty slider, and the amount of time i sunk into it shows that the gameplay loop is more than good enough.
- the story is meh, pretentious drivel or maybe it's just not for me.
- the atmosphere works but not really something to write home about. It wasn't one of those things that had me giddy to open the game again, but maybe it's just that dreary isn't something I search for in my free time.

By the time I realized killing dragons wasn't triggering a spark of emotion I had to accept that it was time to stop. Not recommending the game only because 60$ for a game not worth finishing that also relies a lot on fast reflexes and persistence seems a bit steep. Felt the same with Sekiro when I had to kill 10 mobs covertly before I could attempt the larger boss, Doing it once was exciting, but by the time I beat the boss, it was like a 3-4 minute chore I have to do before I was allowed to actually enjoy the game.",2023-02-03 21:50:46,False,9,0,False,False,232,3,2510,0,2510,2022-06-22 21:30:18,320,0.8687,positive,3 stars,0.5588916465640068

Pros:
•	Perfect visual and music
•	Spectacular combination of open-world with traditional Soulsborne locations
•	Challenging and rewarding combat
•	Quests require exploration
Cons:
•	Boss AI frequently gets stuck
•	Lots of repetitive bosses
•	Some attacks and combos are almost impossible to evade
•	Ping in PVP is frustrating
•	Sometimes crashes

Summary:
Even hearing people complaining that the game is a Dark Souls 4, I can simply say that it is not just a Dark Souls 4. It’s the Dark Souls 4 in open-world, with plot easier to grasp and a combination of the best features and mechanics from previous games. Generally, its not as perfect as DSIII, but taking into consideration me playing the former years after release, and this game just after the first day patch, after some updates it would receive a 10/10.

I probably consider to play DS trilogy, BB and Sekiro if I have courage enough lol.

The only issues I having is the FPS sometime dropping  but I'm okay with 45 FPS and it was pretty smooth. 

When playing multiplayer sometimes I don't know they either use original items or mods because you encounter them especially during invasion or they invade you, it will bring unbalanced to the game but hey it still fun by getting your ass kicked. 

The boss was pretty good but spamming AoE was really make the boss fight annoying mostly on Godfrey and Radagon while Elden Beast keep get away from you was also annoying. Too many same mini bosses but I understand the reason of the repetition because for lore accuracy or possibly run out of ideas due to largest open world design but still, I was hoping different types of bosses to be include.

8417,132119867,"I get that a lot of people like this game, and there are many likable things about it. It's certainly a complete and high quality game (unlike most games released these days). The early sequence with the castle is great, exploring was fun... sometimes. But unfortunately this is a wiki-game. I'm gonna compare this a lot to BotW because that was a good open world game.
If you're not playing a basic strength build or know how to find the overpowered weapons you're guaranteed to have a bad time. 

The rpg mechanics are fundamentally unfun here. If you put points in multiple stats to use cool new items you will just have an incredibly weak character. Instead focus on only one stat and use almost no items. Great thanks, love that. Imagine if that happened in BotW? I guess the idea is to make more than one character. But nah. I'm good. 

But then the real fail is still coming. So far, these issues existed in DS3 & DS1, but those games are still incredible. So why is this one particularly awful?
*  This is such a wiki-game it hurts. The summoning bell is given randomly at night time at the first bonfire. What an incredibly dumb decision. Why does it feel like this game was designed to randomly make some people have a good time and for some people the game will be unplayable? This didn't happen to me, I was able to buy the bell at firelink shrine for some reason. There are many more examples of dumb shit like this.
*  Open world does us no favors here. Randomly stuck in crystal cave with only enemies that one shot me? Why? Copy paste dungeons with weak rewards. I snooze. Breath of the wild shrines were always unique and interesting. An endless array of locked doors to which I must randomly find keys? Why? 
Okay so you want me to explore. I'll try that. Crossed a bridge, fought some giants. That was pretty fun, cool stuff. Now what, it seems to be a dead end. Do I need to go inside the bridge? Jump at a certain angle? There must be a secret I missed somewhere. No, it turns out this is a place you can go to after you beat Godrick. Otherwise it's a waste of time. 
How twisted is this. You want me to explore an 'open world' but in reality you want me to randomly stumble to find the intended linear path.

Just take assets and give me DS4 instead. I thought I might just follow a walkthrough so I could experience it without the tedious metroidvania openworld dogshit. But it just feels like a chore to be honest. A wiki-game will always be a wiki-game. Can put this one in the same bucket as dwarf fortress. It really pains me to bash Elden Ring since so many other people seem to like it. I liked DS1 & DS3 so I thought I would be like them.

Absolutely incredible, I love it to bits, and it may even be my favorite game EVER(Breath of The Wild being it's competitor. We'll have to see If Tears of the kingdom can best either though.) I'd say it's a must have if you love open world games, though if you don't enjoy the punishing difficulty, I Suggest going to nexus mods and downloading an easy Elden Ring mod. Or at the very least, a mod that rebalances the game. I have no doubt that many may find that statement blasphemy, but I believe it's fine as long as the user is having fun.  

I do have one issue though, and that is how quests are handled. A concerning amount of quests in the game, perhaps even most of them, are incredibly hard to follow. Really the only one that's easy to follow is the default main story quest. Most others require incredible luck, unending wit, or a simple google search for a guide. If they included a quest book of sorts, with simply reminding you of what npcs have said, and some slight nudges in the right direction, it would improve the game greatly. I'd go as far as to give it a 10/10 if there was.

TL;DR
I fully recommend it. I love it dearly, despite not having even finished it, and give it a 9.5/10. It would be 10/10, if they included a quest book, and perhaps some much needed rebalancing.",2023-02-03 11:31:25,True,0,0,True,False,43,4,3723,0,2312,2023-02-09 05:35:19,244,0.9903,positive,5 stars,0.6449563900629679

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

This game has got to be one of my favourite games in terms of how it just seems to grab my attention at every moment.
I always have a goal to reach, a quest to complete, a skill to hone. 
Always having something to strive towards, that changes as frequently as it does in elden ring is something truly wonderful - it's never a dull moment - and is one of the few progression-based games I can confidently say I have not gotten tired of after a few hundred hours.
DLC to come soon I hear, so I will be looking forward to that, but for now - community creations are splendid for adding a little bit more to the game that you just needed, such as;
different combat styles, gameplay changes, difficulties, graphics, fixes, styles and presets

10/10 gameplay (difficult if you want it to be, easy if you want it to be)
10/10 graphics (actual game areas are visually splended; but in terms of just graphics itself, you can also mod in high quality textures, meshes and RTGI if you feel it doesn't suit your needs)
7/10 performance (some VERY small bugs you may run into once in your entire playthrough, as well as some slight FPS stuttering in certain areas {both fixable with mods})

Perhaps what I am describing below is what mainly or partly explains the Elden rings award of ""BEST GAME YOU SUCK AT AWARD"".
The character control in this game is not as natural as any other RPG game I´ve played before when using keyboard and mouse. During fights, it´s almost like your mouse&keyboard turns into a D-pad. That´s the best way of describing it. The precision of that is obviously useless when trying to hit your enemies. During a fight you´ll basically be swinging your weapon front, right, left or rear. Not by the aim of your mouse. I think most people who´ve played god of war know´s what I am saying here. I am glad I got it for 50% but if I knew this I would not have bought this game.

8598,132082471,"Elden Ring is basically an open world version of the Dark Souls games with some serious improvements. The first improvement being there's a story at play that doesn't require heavy investment into paying attention to the item description based lore. That lore is still there, so don't get that crossed. The second huge improvement is that there's real platforming to do, though it only plays out in fights or boss battles some of the time. Most combat isn't much different than in the Souls titles, however, we've a dedicated jump button, ash summons, and several other tools at play we didn't in those other games. Would go on, but I'm pretty sure most people already know what to expect of a Souls-like game. My only word of warning is that this isn't Dark Souls. It's much easier if you wanna make it easier. It's also much harder if you wanna make it harder. By which I mean Elden Ring is really Dark Souls with options. A lot of different options to every fight and choice you make in game just about.

The PC version at this point in time is the best place to play Elden Ring in my opinion. Runs very smoothly. That said, I'm writing this at 200+ hours and leaving only the last boss to beat.

Some pros: 
*Spectacular open world, without overbearing markers and logs, emphasizing exploration.
*Memorable, distinct atmosphere and design.
*You can tell there's worldbuilding of unusual quality hiding in the background (probably GRRM work).
*Excellent, well-balanced combat which rewards you for paying attention and preparing.
*Best game since Witcher 3.

Some cons:
*Performance issues on PC (mostly stuttering)
*The difficulty curve, and how you progress through the game, is somewhat poorly executed and balanced, but it's fine.
*Probably not the best UI and control scheme.
*A lot of players who think the high difficulty means they're special for beating the game.

8620,132077261,"The greatest FromSoftware game I've ever played and the best open world RPG. Everywhere I go there's something to find some new boss to fight some new weapon, a new incantation, sorceries, bows, shields just something worth finding and the good feeling I get when I do so. This game has attached itself to  the receivers in my brain that have turned into ELDEN RING receivers instead. The first 40 hours of the game are honestly the best experience I've had in a while and I wouldn't trade it for anything else. 
 
 There is a reason why I said the first 40 hours though, after leaving the capital city, Leyndell, the quality takes a dip. And a DIP at that. Most bosses I saw in very special places and got to fight at the end of long questlines are just in mines and out in the open just sitting there for no reason. In the early game whenever I got to see a big enemy I always wanted to fight and best them but in the snow covered mountaintops all I've ever done is just wave past with Torrent.

 I think the issues in the game can be fixed, but the community's point of view towards issues are also something to be wary of. The ""hardest"" fight, Malenia, is barely hard if  you're using every tool the game gives you to beat her. The reason a lot of the bosses in the game feel like they were made for Sekiro and not Elden Ring and there being no way (literally no way, like there isn't a single way you don't take damage in some bosses' attacks) is because you aren't using Spirit Ashes to pull aggro from the boss, which seems like that's what they were balanced towards. However, I will agree that spirit ashes feel like you're ""cheating"" towards the latter stages of the game (especially mimic) and balancing them will no doubt prove extremely difficult for FromSoftware.

This is my first experience with a souls-like and I have greatly enjoyed it.
It's definitely difficult, and you may have to 'git gud' but it gives you a lot of freedom to tackle challenges they way you prefer and in the order you prefer. There's a lot of room for you to upgrade your skills and equipment such that each boss fight is accessible.
The open world is massive and gives a genuine feeling of adventure and discovery, as well as danger. You never know what you will run into as you cross the lands between. 
This game deserves all the awards it gets. It's a breath of fresh air among all the cash-grabs coming out of the AAA industry..* cough * EA Sports ...

8715,132044400,"This game is beautiful, but once I got to the Mountaintops, I stopped being able to appreciate it.

Elden Ring's -- like the Dark Souls series before it -- is a combat system built on limitations. Every offensive and defensive option is carried out with either stamina or focus (that is, if you're using magic or ashes of war.) You've also got input buffering to deal with, where button presses have a noticeable delay, and the game registers every input, which WILL lead to accidental panic rolls, drinking flasks one too many times, and doing a mistaken follow-up R2 after doing a jump attack.

It's a feature endlessly at odds with the committal controls. You can't cancel your animations, so a good handful of player deaths are a result of people failing to account for an enemy's unavoidable punisher(s) while they're stuck in some animation. This wouldn't be such an issue if enemies didn't all have uniquely rapid combos they can chain together endlessly, and that's on top of everything being way too fast and two-shotting you in the endgame. Not even just bosses, but regular enemies. Many bosses and enemies are simply designed with movesets meant to counter the ""few"" combat mechanics you have at your disposal.

However, I have to say ""few"" in quotes because there is a wide variety of spells in the game, along with many special attacks you can add to weapons in the form of ashes of war. If you're able to find an effective combination of these things, you can trivialize a lot of the fights, but this solution highlights my main grievance with this game. If something isn't working, you're not meant to adapt to an enemy until it does. You're meant to trivialize the shit by min-maxing. That kind of stuff may be fun for PVP, but, unless they're an invader, enemies don't play by the same rules you do.

All of this wouldn't be such a problem if there were another angle to the gameplay, but fighting your way through the world is the only thing your character is good for, sadly. And that's a real shame when you have such cool a setting with so many major characters. Imagine pledging fealty to a Shardbearer with a kneel emote in the middle of battle or something, and then you get to join their faction instead of just killing every single one of them. That's the kind of shit I play RPGs for, but all you get here are fragmented questlines you need spoilers just to complete, and omniscient item descriptions.

My final note: I know nothing of the game's community or meta or what-have-you, but if the only way I can enjoy or beat a game is by looking up everything and playing it someone else's way, then the game just ain't for me. And on the off-chance you're anything like me, then it probably ain't for you either.",2023-02-02 06:23:49,False,0,0,True,False,88,2,10769,0,10769,2023-02-02 04:57:21,489,-0.9907,negative,3 stars,0.41498781243960065

-Attacks often have ridiculous delays. The problem with the delays is not that they take too long it's that the enemy simply stands there with their weapon up with little to no animation so you basically have to see them do the animation and start counting, get hit and remember to how much you counted everytime they do that attack again to properly dodge it. This happens for the whole game, even the final boss does it.

-Chain attacks are too fast sometimes. Sometimes the enemy follows an attack with another so fast that you still are on the roll animation you used to dodge the first attack, this doesn't happen very often but it's very frustrating when it does specially when it stunlocks you to death.

-The open world is too open. This one is more personal, probably most people will love this but I can't leave a zone peacefully without feeling like I missed half of the things it has to offer, and this does happen, unless you use a wiki to see where everything the zone has to offer is then you will miss dungeons, legendary armaments/magics and even NPCs with questlines. This probably helps make every person's walkthrough more unique when not using the wiki.

-Plenty of reused bosses. There are both reused bosses behind fog walls and on the overworld and because of the delayed attacks and the fast chain attacks finding a reused boss on the overworld as a normal enemy, respawning and all is painfull.",2023-02-01 20:03:05,False,3,2,True,False,214,24,11047,166,9964,2023-03-02 00:20:06,334,-0.9965,negative,2 stars,0.40366191416978836

Fromsoftware creating masterpieces back to back, from Bloodborne, to DS3, to Sekiro, and finally Elden Ring, they never let down once in many years.

If someone reviews this game and says it is overhyped without atleast having 20 hours into the game or atleast getting to the point of fighting Rennala, that person needs to GIT GUD. (jk)
Tho I would enjoy a boss rush mode and even though it also felt the bosses weren't meant for this combat, the bosses are a visual eye candy and absolutely incredible to fight! (Not you godskin Duo)

+game length is about 20-25 hours of content, good compared to AAA 4 hrs  (see GoW, MW etc)

-No support for Keyboard and mouse (why port to PC and have no improvement on your DS BS). Tell me why i can't bind heal to one of the other 78 keys 
-No map features or waypoints (waste 30 hours)
-No journals (waste 10 hours)
-Scrubs reeing about 'no journal is good' when it's just a waste of time
- Give enemies 4x the amount of health they need and call it 'challange' (sic)
-really slow ass rogue lite. In that light, rogue Legacy 2 was way better.
-don't give an F** about your character, it's a mindless blob with no conscience (same for all JRPGs tbh)

Story: The story is... complicated. a lot of the story and lore of the world is very hidden. speaking to npc's gives you scraps of what the world your currently in but if you want the real deep cut lore you have to go looking.

Graphics: Literately (and i don't mean that as figuratively)  one of the best looking games of all time. the only game i can say is better is red dead redemption 2. they have completely different art styles so it probably boils down to personal preference but the visuals are just amazing.

Gameplay: I am a newbie to souls likes so this perspictive is coming from that point of view. This game KICKED MY ASS! but it didn't really bother me too much since i was enthralled with the open world i just wounded up exploring and eventually i became compented and leveld up enough to face the ""first real"" boss. and man that was not easy. took me a good hour 1/2 but when i finally bested him the dopamine realse was so fucking worth it.

Conclusion: this game is hard (duh) but you will learn how to as they say *git gud* the graphics are phenomenal and the gameplay feels amazing.

Not being able to go back and explore together after you clear a boss,

9001,131978424,"Ill be honest. 
I've never really ever liked single player games. I've tried the whole lot of them, none of them I ever really liked or for any matter, got into at all. It took me a long time of debating on this one after seeing all the praise it got, but as you can see, i'm here. Some people call this game misdirected, or maybe even ""too hard"" But I call it the closest thing you can get to perfection in a video game. Here's why:

Elden Ring teaches you about discipline, it teaches you about commitment, and it also teaches you about freedom. There is a common misconception behind this game, some people say its too cryptic to know where your going. Which is the complete opposite of why this game absolutely excels. Elden Ring gives you absolute and total control of where you want your character to go in the open world it provided. You will rarely find any aspects of the game that limit you to where they want you to go. Making it the absolute holy grail of open worlds. 

Elden Ring will help you with real life scenarios and issues, This game will ultimately help to train you to achieve your goals, because throughout playing this game not only to you have to manage your anger (as did I) but you have to push through when you find a certain aspect difficult. Which is why the intense difficulty of the game makes it different and refreshing from every other game currently out there. 

The Story is stunning, as well as the visuals. Cutscenes are almost as if not more immersive than a film. You will find yourself immersed in the world of Elden Ring immediately. 

Even if you don't consider yourself a video game type of guy, or a single player type of guy, I recommend you try this game out. Take my word for it, its great.",2023-02-01 03:58:27,True,0,0,True,False,53,3,6145,16,5595,2023-03-03 04:27:56,324,0.9897,positive,1 star,0.6213774904608727

bad things? (no spoilers)
 - there is a lot less back and forth than previous games. you have to wait your turn to do damage to a lot of the bosses.
 - open world elements like catacombs are really repetitive, and only worth it if you check ahead of time for the rewards in each one.
 - the sprawling detail filled world seems to take a big dive in quality in the second half (after the big story midpoint)
- boss runbacks are still really annoying. theyve added the totems to a lot of bosses which is great. but there are still tons of bosses with really long and irritating runbacks.

9048,131971325,"Took me 200 hours to beat it. As someone who likes to take their time and explore as much as my intuition guides me, this game is a GEM. I don't think the story is even slightly good, at least as far as presentation, and most of the quests do a really bad job of getting you attached to characters or even allowing you to understand what's going on at all, but that is overshadowed by the fact that the combat and exploration are so incredible, that I've never played a game that even comes close to how pleasant these aspects of the game are to interact with. Not even Breath of the Wild comes close. Elden Ring does everything Breath of the Wild tried to do, but better in every way. Dungeon crawling, exploration, stimulating a sense of community, combat, etc.. Even in way of the story tbh, and I personally really don't care for this game's story (even after watching dozens of hours of lore videos) so that's saying a lot lol.

This game is one of — if not — THE BEST video game I've ever played. It's not perfect though. I personally don't like that the game discourages you from experimenting with weapons by forcing you upgrade them before they have any meaningful combat effect. Some of the quests are just ridiculous and force you to use a guide or have a friend tell you what to do, which don't get me wrong, isn't just clearly a bad thing. When Zelda came out, a goal for the developers was to put in secrets and whatnot so that players can share important details with each other and stimulate a sense of community. Because of the cryptic nature of Elden Ring's quests and general design, Elden Ring succeeds in creating a healthy sense of community, which I believe Zelda failed at, especially in comparison to Elden Ring.

Elden Ring will leave its mark on gaming and will change the way developers move forward and make decisions. By missing out on Elden Ring, you're missing out on history. I've heard this kind of praise before playing the game, and was iffy about its validity, but I was wrong to doubt it.

9081,131966578,"Oh, Elden Ring!

*Small spoiler warning for boss names*

Absolutely brimming with great content, Elden Ring surpassed my unhealthily high expectations.
As a veteran of the series, I was very hyped for ER (probably too much), yet the game still blew me away.
The small dungeons were what I was most worried about. Most games of ER's size tend to re-use dungeons, and while some of them feel samey, they were clearly made with a lot of effort. Their difficulty progresses very well throughout the game, and the late game ones are worth every minute of exploration. 

The bosses are outstanding, but Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne are still (in my opinion, this is very subjective) the games with the best fights in the series. Elden Ring's best bosses have minor flaws which make them just a bit more annoying than enjoyable. To give examples: Malenia's damage output and Waterfowl dance; Mohg's bloodflame covering the entire arena, making bloodloss unavoidable if you're too unlucky; Rykard's nearly unavoidable exploding skulls; Placidusax's huge health bar that makes the fight an endurance test like no other; and so on. However, don't get me wrong: All of these bosses are still very fun. These flaws are minor annoyances. 

The music is truly outstanding, and I have nothing negative to say about it. Morgott, Mohg, Malenia, Placidusax, The Godskin Apostles, and many more amazing tracks are among the series' best.

The graphics are nothing revolutionary, but the art style is unforgettable. There is a geoguessr game for ER (lostgamer.io), but all the locations are so distinct from one another that it's very easy to guess them all just from a single playthrough. Boss designs, area designs, everything is so full of life that you wonder how they managed to make it all in 5 years.

Conclusion: one of the best games ever made, well worth the money, and then some. Fingers crossed that FromSoftware will keep up the tradition of making the DLC the most epic and over the top (in a good way) experience in gaming history.",2023-01-31 22:58:58,True,0,0,True,False,16,1,26158,73,25512,2023-02-24 15:42:02,343,0.9966,positive,5 stars,0.4723052531480789

No microtransactions, NFTs and surprise lootboxes, rare these days so support it when it happens.
PVP is bad, worst I've seen in a Souls game. So if you like gank squads this is the PVP game for you. You can duel and arena but the core Dark Souls invasion is just comicly bad.

9122,131957723,"Questo gioco non è solo un Dark Souls in cui puoi saltare, è un open world originale e innovativo. Ogni dungeon, ogni singola zona di interesse da qualcosa di unico non randomico e realmente utile. Hai la sensazione che ogni singolo dungeon sia servito alla crescita del tuo personaggio e non perchè hai ottenuto 2 anime, 20 monete e 1 ciabatta in più di prima come in qualsiasi altro gioco, ma perchè hai ottenuto un oggetto che non avresti potuto trovare da nessun' altra parte e che potrebbe realmente servirti in futuro.
Lo stile artistico è incredibile, ti fa dire ""wow, che grafica pazzesca"" anche se in realtà è una grafica di 5 anni fa, perciò non credete a chi dice che la grafica di Elden Ring è brutta perchè anche se dal lato tecnico non sorprende è comunque migliore di Dark Souls 3 ed è accompagnato da uno stile unico ed estremamente elaborato.
Dal lato difficoltà non è una passeggiata ma poteva essere più difficile. Tolto il boss finale che credo di esserci arrivato sopralivellato avendo fatto letteralmente tutto prima di arrivarci, quindi credo sia normale mi fosse risultato troppo semplice, i boss dei dungeon secondari sono tipo 6 e vengono ripetuti più volte con qualche leggera modifica nell'arena e nelle mosse. Essendo di partenza non troppo difficili, capite che alla quinta volta che lo affronti è quasi un nemico normale, ANZI, certe volte lo diventa davvero. I boss di trama sono impegnativi, ma almeno io non credo di aver mai superato i 15 try con nessun boss. Gli unici boss che mi sono risultati davvero difficili, e quando dico difficili dico DIFFICILI, sono un boss opzionale e nascosto e un boss primario particolare dove dovresti evocare 5 - 6 persone ma l'ho voluto affrontare da solo, nessun altro. Tutti gli altri boss sono difficili solo se perdendovi nella mappa ci arrivate sotto livellati.
Pecche del gioco? La magia. Oh, ogni arma che trovi 3 volte su 4 scala in fede. CHE PUALLE, ho capito l'albero ancestrale fatto di luce e sacro, ma cazzo se voglio fare una build no magia rispetto a chi ha fede e intelligenza posso usare 3 armi in croce, il coltello preso dalla cucina di Melina, una pantofola e i miei pugni. Ogni volta è un ""Si, sapevo che c'era un dungeon qui"" che finisce in un ""si va beh ma che ca"". Che poi sono pure fighe quelle armi, ma sono tutte in fede. MA a parte questo, le magie e le stregonerie sono rotte. Ho giocato insieme ad un mio amico con una build solo magia, io contro i boss con la mia build solo melee avevo una vera sfida, impegnativa e divertente, lui primo try, usa la magia da distanza, non ha bisogno di imparare il moveset dei boss perchè sta sempre lontano e fa comunque i miei stessi danni se non di più, easy gioco finito.
In conclusione, gioco che merita, grande stile, impegnativo ma non esagerato come alcuni pensano, originale, estremamente rigiocabile, longevo e personalmente molto divertente. Alcuni mini boss sono troppo riciclati, le armi tendono troppo verso la fede e la magia è OP e rovina l'esperienza, ma non è niente rispetto ai moltissimi lati positivi che il gioco ha.
Se vi piacciono gli open world rpg e non volete tutto servito su un piatto d'argento, è il gioco che fa per voi. Solo un consiglio, almeno per la prima run cercate di tendere al melee e non troppo alla magia, avrete un esperienza estremamente più divertente e soddisfacente",2023-01-31 19:58:15,True,1,0,False,False,51,26,1749,0,1392,2023-02-02 21:44:08,591,0.4019,positive,5 stars,0.4919446451323373

9133,131956237,"I want to first say that I don't want to recommend, or not recommend this game.  For some it will be phenomenal, while for others it will be terrible, and that is just a fact.  It's a shame I am forced to select one or the other.  Since the game is so hyped in one direction, recommended, I guess I will do the opposite in the spirit of balance.

I don't get the appeal of games like this.  They are TOO hard to enjoy.   If you want the exploration that is expected in an RPG, you will find it here, but every bat can kill you unless you also enjoy mastering combat.  I don't want to do anything more than press a button to swing a sword, or cast a spell, and perhaps dodge or block like you do in GW2.  If you are like me then I recommend you avoid this game regardless of the rave reviews.

I played this game much longer than I expected because I spent $60 on it, but here are the issues as I see them:

Pros:
1.  Exploration of the open world is really second to none.  This is a fantastic open world with a mystery and excitement to it akin to Everquest 1 when it first released.
2.  The variety of mobs is fairly high
3.  The graphics and ambient sounds are well done
4.  The first act of the game, when mobs are not ridiculous and everything is new, is simply the best experience I have had in years.  Most reviews go on and on about this same thing so I won't reiterate it here.

What most reviews don't mention are the negatives, and there are negatives for many types of players despite the thousands of positive reviews.

Cons:
1.  Tedious:  if you die you lose  all runes which are collected like gold would be in most games, but are also the only way to level; you get one shot to pick them up again, but if you die they are gone for good along with every single bit of progress you have made in earning them.  Also, when you die ALL previously killed mobs respawn and you have to fight your way back through them.  I despise repeating things, and this game is designed to kill you over and over so you will spend a lot of time repeating stuff.
2.  There is no real sense of getting more powerful.  Sure there are mobs you eventually become stronger than, but you are always just a few unfortunate hits and stuns away from death no matter your level, experience, or gear.  
3.  There is no way to adjust difficulty, so if you become mentally weary of the fights and just want to explore the world and story on a slighty lower intensity, you can forget it.
4.  After reaching the capital you will notice that mobs move beyond challenging into the realm of being unfair.  They have stuns, endless combos, ridiculous jumps, unblockable hits, and are so large and fast you cannot outrun them; nevermind the encounters in quests or dungeons which occur in cramped quarters where you have to master combat to have a chance.  You may like to master combat, but the truth is there is luck involved in many of the boss fights, and not everyone likes the combat as much as the exploration or other things.
5.  There is no quest journal to track steps completed, or even repeat goals or remind you of NPC names, or locations where you found them.  That isn't just not holding your hand, that is stupid and not respecting your time.
6.  The story really isn't very good at all.  I understand that is subjective, but many players couldn't tell you the story if you asked them, unless they had read it from a third party site.  Even if you do know it, it is boring, and RPGs are supposed to be story-driven, so a weak or non-compelling story-line is a problem.
7.  You will experience burnout if you are like many others who have stated they eventually just skip fights and run straight through zones in the endgame, just wanting to say they completed the game, and for it to be over.  In fact, I've read that many, myself included, have decided to not complete the game because it has become a chore.
8.  There are hidden features like using gestures to unlock hidden areas supposedly.  Well, you first have to find the gestures, then find the areas to use them, and then figure out which one to use.  I would normally like such a feature, but I find it annoying in this game.  If you try the game you will see what I mean.
9.  The game implements soft caps on stats to force you to diversify your build and try different things.  Look, if I want to max a stat and use the same weapon the whole game, then that is my business.  Stop artificially forcing me to try play-styles I don't like.

There is more to say, but there isn't much point when a game is so highly rated.  The game has real issues for certain gamers that will continue to be dismissed by the fans who say that I need to get better at the game.  But you see, I don't WANT to get better.  I just want to enjoy the Elden Ring world using MY playstyle, not yours.  This is one of the only developers that has decided they absolutely will not do that; it is their MO.  I am all about developers deciding what type of game they want to make, and sticking to it.  Elden Ring does that and I say good for them, but the result is a gamer like me is eventually driven away.  Fans of this series are happy about that, because they are so scared the things they like will be changed, or that their bragging rights will become meaningless as more people can kill the bosses they do, but I think this is silly.  There is some multiplayer functionality, but in the end this is a single player RPG and one gamer's sense of accomplishment shouldn't hinge on another gamer being shutout of the experience of the game to protect fragile egos and placate irrational fears.  Let as many people as possible experience and enjoy the fantasy world created I say.

For the reasons just stated, the game is so hyped that I believe the reviews never give you a fair assessment of the negatives, or at least the full picture.  This game isn't just ""not for everyone because it's hard.""  This game isn't for everyone because it has problems like any other.  It doesn't have the best boss fights that exist, even if that is your thing.  It is a challenge, and it is well done, but there is a HUGE segment of gamers that are also wasting their time with this game because it makes ZERO allowances for them in the end.  

I find myself wanting to explore every nook and cranny because the world is that good, but I cannot stand the stupid boss fights and respawning of mobs anymore.  It has become tiring.  I cannot stand that I can't turn the difficulty down if I want to.  I cannot stand that  the game is designed to make you repeat stuff because it wants you to die to experience a sense of accomplishment.  Hey, if that's you then great, but it isn't me, and this game doesn't take a player like me into account.  I wish it did.",2023-01-31 19:29:48,False,0,0,True,False,121,11,12148,2670,70,2023-03-07 02:55:08,1273,-0.9849,negative,2 stars,0.45935230382851194

Why?
1. The camera becomes a curse (malliketh and firegiant)
2. Some bosses are hard just for the sake of being hard and have ultra armor (malennia and radahn) 
3. The game doesn't hold your hand (this is good) BUT the game doesn't point either, this is the first game where I have lost soooo many sidequests or have had to look up guides to play sidequests. Should have taken rdr2s logo approach on this.

Youtube is your friend here.  I mean, games like The Witcher 3 like you choose difficulty and then raise it as you get better and learn the tricks.  If you're struggling, go get that dragon and have fun. It's still plenty challenging even getting up to the mid thirties level to start. 

Also I like to play my own ambient station in the background instead of the game music most times, unless you REALLY want to hear those drums for when enemies are near.

9176,131945058,"Complicated, ugly and over hyped. 
Like most fromsoft games this game is pretty difficult. This is not something that I enjoy or care for at this point in my life. Good luck having any sort of success in this game without constantly having to look up guides for bosses, weapons, where to go next, etc. For some reason there is nothing to aid the player with where to go next. No log or quest tracker. 

Also the game is very ugly and dull to look at (compare with the vibrant and colorful environment of Ghost of Tsushima for instance). But perhaps this is not a surprise given how dull and ugly Sekiro is as well. 

Personal opinion, but the game is overhyped. I purchased it on day 1 for PS5 and it never pulled me in. I played it for 30 minutes, put it down until a few days later. Then I did it a couple of more times before I decided to sell the game. I decided to give it another try on steam deck and I'll admit I got much farther this time than I thought I ever would, but that is because I had the help of an experienced friend.
A positive is that it does a great job at making the player feel small in an over the top world. 

Every time I start the game up I just want to uninstall. At this point in my life I do not find joy in games like this that require focus and patience.
If you do not like to try hard then you will not like this game. Maybe if you have an experienced friend with this game you will have fun. I did not enjoy this game and I do not recommend it if you do not like a struggle.

9204,131933140,"One of the best games ever made, very worthy of winning GOTY, insane replayability with the insane amount of builds you can make, areas you can explore and different ways you can play the game. The main bosses are great (The last one is a bit underwhelming), the side bosses are okay, if you don`t like repeating bosses you can just skip them, the scenarios and the setting of the game is absolutely gorgeous, every weapon in the game is usable and can be pretty good if you know how to build around them, so every playstyle is viable. 

The only area this game really lacks in is modding, modding is hard and a pain in the ass compared to most other games, also all the running around when in new game+ but that is understandable to keep the game`s progression path.

The only reason I can`t give this game a 10/10 is because that is of course reserved to the perfect games, with no flaws, this game has some flaws, the end-game is flawed, the last boss is flawed, and the endgame is pretty important to get right, but besides that it`s such a great game that a 9.8 is very much deserved and it definitely worth your money, it is a MUST PLAY game, and if you haven`t played any FROMSOFTWARE game before, just keep at it, don`t give up and you will have a great time.

This feels like a game that was made decades ago and had a remake to look better. The only positives is that the game looks gorgeous, and the areas and dungeons are really well made. Even though the bosses are way over the top to your normal character they are also really cool.

Weakest story out of all the From titles I've played yet, vague with little substance below the surface. By far the most unbalanced and unfun gameplay, accidentally made an OP bleed build and destroyed the entire first 80% of the game and then had to spend overly difficult hours on the last few bosses, notably excluding Miquella and Mohg as I had accidentally cheesed them both with overpowered weapon arts and spirit ashes. (Bloody slash allowed me to kill Mohg without him reaching his second phase.)

A terrible symbol of the nature of broad and expansive open world games, which innovates in the first 20 to 30 hours with Liurnia being a great area, representing good world design with great encouragement of curiousity, and then the rest of the open world areas being largely bland and classic Ubisoft-y.

What the f*k did I just play. The graphics, the gameplay, the music, the atmosphere, the variety of enemies, the weapons/weapon arts and the story that even a layman like myself was able to uncover on my own, GOD tier.
I have played the dark souls 1 and 3 and never found a reason to use a weapon other that a good one I found at the start and finished both games only using a single weapon from the start till the end. But elden ring was different. Even when I liked using a katana build I changed to a magic one the fist time ever, and then to a faith magic hybrid and the finally to the Guts Greatsword one. Everything you do in this game is not enough, you will find something new to do everytime you log in. Either a new weapon to try out, a new spirit to use in battle, a new area to explore, a new boss to defeat, a new adventure beyond what you just experienced. If you think I'm an ""abuse victim"" for liking elden ring, then YES, I am one.

Elden Ring is one of the most solid games ever created, and rivals the rest of the FromSoftware catalogue for best title they've ever created. The problem is, Elden Ring seems to have taken a tip from the original Dark Souls by making the second half of the game filled with unnecessary difficulty spikes, that make the game less fun and more frustrating than challenging.
One such example of this is a section in the optional area of the [spoiler] 'Consecrated Snowfield' [/spoiler], this section is known as [spoiler] 'Ordina, Litgurgical Town' [/spoiler]. In this section there seems to be a lack of thought in the design, and it pairs the weakest part of these games - the platforming - with archer enemies placed in hard to reach positions that fire both very quick, and very fast. Alongside this, there are invisible assassin enemies who can crit you and then go invisible once more, leaving only a small window to actually hit them.
Another example of this difficulty, and what I consider the main one, is the bosses - the bosses in the second half seem to have too much health, and deal too much damage, with almost all of them after [spoiler] Morgott [/spoiler] being able to 1 to 3 hit you depending on your build. This, I do not find challenging, just completely unfair; the worst offender is by far [spoiler] The Fire Giant [/spoiler] who might be the most infuriating mainline boss From has ever created.
On the other hand, this title is the most expansive, most open and offers the most diverse build variety of any of the titles that FromSoft have created before. I also think this is among one of its most polished titles, which is why the unnecessary difficulty in certain sections makes it so frustrating as a title. Why bring down the quality of this game by designing unfair, and thus unenjoyable sections in a near perfect title? I think it has something to do with the legacy that FromSoftware has left behind with their souls-like genre; that of the idea that a souls-like must be difficult. This in turn can sometimes result in artificial difficulty over real challenge in order to make the game fit this image of being a 'difficult game'.
However, I must whole-heartedly recommend this title, as it's easily one of the best games I've ever played, and probably will ever play.",2023-01-30 14:06:47,True,0,0,True,False,329,20,13222,1323,11898,2023-03-07 14:27:55,452,-0.9433,negative,3 stars,0.5604111651579539

9496,131857776,"I apologize for my ineloquency - I usually don't write ""reviews"" but I just need to get this out of my system, so to speak.

First things first, if you're planning to play Elden Ring as your first ""souls-like"" - please, try Dark Souls 1 instead. It's an all around better game.

As for this game, I can't for the [i]life[/i] of me fathom why it was so praised. 
Maybe I'm just tired of the generic ""souls"" formula, or maybe it's just my MDD that keeps gets worse. 
But Elden Ring - in my opinion - is by far the worst, so to say, ""souls-like"" developed by FromSoftware - Dark Souls 2 included.
Now, I think the developers/designers responsible for creating the ""overworld"" map indeed did a fantastic job, and the beginning of this game was somewhat promising. 
However, other than that - Elden Ring is a creatively bankrupt, tedious, unbalanced, at some points borderline broken and worst of all - simply boring - mess.

Balancing issues aside - the game's main problem, I think, is that it's obscenely bloated with copypasted content:
- Copypasted locations - which ruined any kind of atmosphere/immersion and disincentivized any point in exploration - the strongest, so say, aspect of previous From's ""souls-clones"". 
Even the major late-game locations are heavily, if I'm not mistaken, the correct term is - ""asset-flipped"" versions of previous locations - and there's only ~7 of them in the entire game. 
The other ~52 areas are just small ""mini-dungeons"". They in particular are just horrendous. Sure, you get some kind of - usually worthless - item at the end of yet another Cave/Crypt (that's all there is to it to the variety). But everything looks exactly the same - what was even the point? I mean, it would've been nice if the combat system wasn't so repetitive, but unfortunately - it is. 
Even Bloodborne did it better with its random Chalice Dungeons. 

- Copypasted enemies. In comparison with From's previous titles, in which each area usually had an array of unique enemy types, Elden Ring exhausts most of its, so to say, bestiary in barely ~1.5-3 hours of gameplay. 
After that, it's, once again - just the same exact mobs that exponentially turn into obnoxious damage-sponges. And it really doesn't help that quite a lot of creatures (and player's character) repurpose animations assets from From's previous games - mostly Dark Souls 3.

- Majority of bosses (a lot of which were reused as regular enemy mobs) were also haphazardly copypasted. 
And all the story-bosses felt completely unimaginative, forgettable and, with exception to a couple of end-game ones - trivial. 
I even bothered to stop leveling at some point and used a guide on how to NOT get accidentally overpowered - which is an easy thing to do, because this game has a rather broken progression system.

The battle content designers, also, seem to have ran out of ideas and made the main bosses rely on cheap ""delayed"" attacks, annoying lingering AOEs and 1-shot gimmicks - particularly towards the very end of the game. Which, in my opinion, made this game into the most ""sluggish"" one in the series, despite added jump move from Sekiro - especially for melee characters. Magic is completely overpowered, by the way - I refuse to believe it was thoroughly playtested.
One of the bosses, in particular - ""Malenia, The Meme of This Game"" - was clearly not designed for Elden Ring's combat system at all. Honestly, just google it.

It's really unfortunate that they messed up that badly - especially after aforementioned Sekiro, which had amazing bosses and an even better combat system in general.

Well, to spout at least something positive - I'd say Radahn (a giant goofball on a small horse) - one of the main mid-game bosses, was pretty decent because developers for once actually tried something unique with this one... and he also looked memorably amusing.

But overall, I didn't like Elden Ring. I think it's a barely mediocre game and It's really quite a shame that it wasn't criticized into oblivion - like Dark Souls 2, for example.

And as an another little side note to those who for some reason liked PvP in previous games, even though I'm in no position to talk about it. 
Due to severe balancing issues - PvP here is objectively broken, there's no faction system and invasion-mechanic is also fairly ""strange"" too. 
According to developers, to make invaders less of an issue for players - it's now only possible to invade ganks/groups. I think it just encouraged the use of broken builds and twinking. And for some absurd reason invading someone during a boss battle is also possible and, I should add, there's an easily accessible suicide bomb flask which can 1-shot majority of players (was kind of entertaining a couple of times). Ingenious!

Anyway - again, I apologize for my insane digital rumblings.",2023-01-30 09:27:43,False,9,3,True,False,181,1,4564,0,4536,2023-01-31 03:34:04,820,-0.9963,negative,2 stars,0.500008276104927

My main criticism would be that the overall quality of boss fights had some minor trade-off for more quality exploration but whether that counts as a net positive or negative is going to vary based on preferences. Mechanically it takes all the best parts of the Souls series and adds some great new elements, combat has so many more routes to find your preferred playstyle via Ashes of War, power-stancing, and mounted combat in many areas, new environments are incredible with particular note going to Caelid and the Haligtree as some of the coolest areas to come from a Fromsoft game, and of course practically bottomless rabbitholes for theorizing on lore.

Regardless, i play another game thats similar to his named biomutant and i honestly cant get enough of them.
biomutant is not a souls game but its an open world, self interactive story where you decide what happens.

i would recommend elden ring to anyone who wants a fresh game to play. i seriously enjoy the game when i dont think of it as a souls game.
i just explore landmarks and do stuff, collect everything, find everything there is to discover. even the enemies can make the game entertaining sometimes.
Biomutant is kind of emptier though, but this is about elden ring. environmental story telling is just fantastic and its even better when you get to experience the character quests and how they affect the elden world.

9630,131835592,"This is Dark Souls, but with an open world, and this is the biggest disappointment. The open world is not really interesting to explore and it serves only to move from one dungeon (or world boss) to the next one. And the dungeons and bosses are subpar to Dark Souls 1, I feel. Maybe that's because that game was groundbreaking in many aspects, and Elden Ring is just more of the same. In fact, it really feels like a remix of every other Soulsborne game, and the only new move is the ability to crouch ala Sekiro. There's nothing really innovative in terms of content: the weapons, the enemies, the location design - we've seen it in FromSoftware games before.

Does this mean Elden Ring is a bad game? No, and I totally recommend it, but only because there's nothing else of the same quality on the horizon. But Elden Ring could have been so much more, so much better. Alas...

Honestly, after finishing the game with 100% achievements and beating all key bosses (including Malenia), I can definitely say that the hardest enemies in the game (as in all other Soulsbornes) are camera, controls and performance. I thought 12900k and 3080Ti would be enough for 1440p gaming for a few more years, but no, FromSoftware managed to keep the videocard at 80-90% load at all times, with fps sometimes dropping to 40-50. And camera + controls is the same clunky stuff that I remember back from Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Also, data streaming is really bad. Despite me having 32Gb RAM + 980 Evo Pro, sometimes the game totally froze when loading in a new part of the location.

Well, in the end, it's part of the FromSoftware games DNA, I guess. If they were perfect, they would be too easy. In fact, Elden Ring is already much easier than Dark Souls 1/2/3 and Bloodborne, and even infamous Malenia is not that hard when you exploit her weaknesses (I killed her with a bloodloss build). For instance, it took me 80 hours to beat every key boss and do everything in Elden Ring, while the first Dark Souls took me 70 hours to beat, but I only killed one DLC boss out of three. And I played over 100 hours of Dark Souls 3 without getting all the achievements. So even though the game world looks massive, in terms of length Elden Ring is shorter than its predecessors due to lower difficulty.

So, bottom line, a good Soulsborne game, much more user friendly than the previous ones, but not in any way groundbreaking.",2023-01-29 23:35:48,True,0,0,True,False,921,542,4824,0,4821,2023-02-01 15:44:22,436,-0.9731,negative,2 stars,0.5166956543922424

The open-world game has excessive stuttering issues despite trying various fixes such as lowering graphics and adjusting the NVIDIA control panel. The performance is also impacted by running background applications like Docker. 

I cannot recommend purchasing it at full price on PC in its current state.

(I'm wondering when will From Software run out of ideas what to to call your cursed husk walking the new land in each game) You are embarking on another Dark Souls adventure diluted in Open World formula this time instead of interconnected dungeons. 

Yeah you were expecting the place to look quite f**ked up, and insanely beautiful at the same time, but these developers still surprise me in each game. So you walk out in this beautifully f**ked up world, and by the time you finish your gaming experience will be enriched once again with unforgettable moments, amazing boss fights, just as your vocabulary will be enriched with countless new curse words

Many called this game a direct evolution of Souls games, but it's more like a different take on the genre, changing the format instead of evolving it really. But it worked. Those who are new to these titles, because Elden Ring hype was great, definitely should go back and play some Dark Souls also. If you finished this, you can't say ""I suck at Dark Souls"" because you just finished one. And all these games are unique in their own way.

Oh, by the way PVP is garbage here also. So don't expect some well polished pvp. The latency is just as bad, or even worse than in any other Souls games, the amount of, bugs, gliches, bunny hopping, dodgerolling comedy is amazing :D Invasions don't exist either, they are invitations, they are only calling it invasions for the sake of calling it that.

Anyway, it's a must have, must play, must beat every boss game in your library, it met and exceeded all expectations.

9781,131805702,"My first perfect game on Steam. Elden Ring brings the best of Dark Souls to a beautiful and massive open world RPG. Even more than combat, exploration was truly the most satisfying aspect of this game for myself. A lot of the very best content in this game is hidden behind obscure paths and caves making it so rewarding when you stumble across it. Massive cinematic set pieces in the background make not only for spectacular views upon high ground, but your next potential destination as you can visit practically everything that you see. 

However, the bread and butter of this game is definitely the combat. Bosses are very difficult but very fair when taking into account the vast array of weapons, spells, armor, ashes of war, and spirit ashes. With so many choices, character customization has never been so deep in the Souls Series and when combined with the open world, it really makes for a wonderful RPG.

I really couldn't recommend this game enough. It's truly worthy of the praise it received and I can't wait for the DLC.",2023-01-29 15:29:19,True,1,0,True,False,122,5,10714,0,10642,2023-02-01 02:51:43,181,0.9685,positive,5 stars,0.5400227208932241

9783,131805261,"I do not understand why the game is so hyped, if this is what a ""game of the year"" is, I am loosing my hopes.

The game was clearly made for consoles and porting the user interface and controls to PC was probably done by accident or an working student, but this is not the main problem. The controls are flawed even with a controller, for example there is no walking backwards or sideways which makes hitting enemies unnecessarily hard. The game concept is so swallow: Loot, Level, Kill... why? Because of a indoctrinating lengthy intro video at the start of game which spoon feds you the ""why"" in the fashion of a online training video about the new corporate culture. After this you a set free into a beautify looking, but empty feeling, open world with bare minimum physics and half brain dead AI... and for that you better pull out your reading glasses, because you are going to read a lot of tool tips trying to explain the non-intuitive menu. From this point on wards there is not much more going on that to loot, level, and kill poorly scripted AI that tries to kill you for no good reason.

For me this game has nothing to offer, because its just a grind for the sake of grinding without any real reward.
I would refund it if I would not have bought it with a discount from a 3rd party.

TL;DR:
Nothing is interesting beside the pretty game engine.

The story is like nothing I've ever encountered before. It is a tale of power, of magic, and of destiny - I had to lookup a whole lotta youtube videos for this. The soundtracks are like haunting melodies that lingers in my mind long after I've stepped away from my PC.
